I want my poetry to be eloquent,

Isn't that how good poetry is meant

To be?

But however hard I work and strive,

At something good I'm unable to arrive,

It's a pity!

I want to use ' languid long limbed lady'

Or 'pink hued lotus feet of my love',

But no,

Out pops an ordinary sentence or phrase,

With some prosaic form of praise,

To show.

Of what earthly use my feelings running deep,

And in myriad romantic images steeped?

When I

Get tongue tied in these mundane words of mine,

Which eventually manage to somehow rhyme,

By the by.

I want to use exotic, anguish, awestruck, consumed with passion,

Ceraunophillia, serendipity, dulcet, Ethereal, jubiliation,

As I go,

I want to say I'm rapturous, amorous, yearning, enchanted,

I'm crazy, head over heels with longing, blinded

Also.

Oh how I wish I could write poetry with eloquence,

Pour my heart out in one long soul stirring sentence,

Which will,

Carry the message of how I actually feel,

And make me my loved one's heart steal.
