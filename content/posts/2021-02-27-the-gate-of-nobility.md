It was an unusually hot day at Idukki. The Monsoon was once again short-lived this year. The fan on the dais was generating more noise than air. Phalgunan finished his speech and folded the printout before placing it in his shirt pocket.

The retired schoolmaster-turned-politician of Parakulam Village used to be a much sought-after scriptwriter for political campaigns during his teaching days. In his heydays, the family sat together after dinner to listen to popular leaders orate to his script on All India Radio during election time.

He was a gifted writer thanks to his mastery over Malayalam literature, and had a penchant for the progressive ideologies like *the Master*. They rewarded him with a pittance at times. He did not mind. He did not do it for money. The school was paying him enough to manage the home. He had a farm producing decent cash crops. He was just content to know that his script had been accepted by *the Master*. He had taken his entire family to Kochi to watch *the Master* speak at the University Auditorium. Denied entry because they did not have a VIP Pass, the family had to retreat to the shade of the banyan trees around the sprawling football ground to hear the speech from jarring loudspeakers placed on every tree. Every single word of the speech from *Namaskaram* to *Jai Hind* was an output of his own Pilot pen. But when *the Master* spoke these words, the effect was awe-inspiring. The words reverberated from the walls of the *Niyamasabha* and echoed in New Delhi as well.

It was inevitable that Phalgunan would jump into the political juggernaut soon and serve his *Master.* To redirect all his dedication and energy towards the party, Phalgunan opted to quit teaching and work solely for the party. He donated a major portion of his savings to the party fund. Phalgunan, the politician slowly crept up the rungs of the political ladder. He never missed an opportunity to contribute generously even if it meant he had to borrow. He could not conceal his pride whenever his name started appearing on political posters and leaflets in bolder fonts.

Phalgunan, the leader folded the computer printout that he had just read out and sighed. He had just spoken a cluster of badly scripted lies. His new *Master* was totally irrational. Coalitions were formed with fringe parties who pursued extreme opposite ideologies. Money lenders became new power centres. It became a game of numbers. Numbers that were enough to keep the chair stable until the next elections.

Phalgunan, like the rest of the villagers had already fallen into the debt trap. The crops betrayed them for the third consecutive year. The new *Maste*r went back on his promise to waive loans, to appease the fringe coalition leaders whose few seats tilted the power balance. Crime had risen. Pesticides were more used to end lives than for the intended purpose.

Private financiers made hay as farmers consumed crop loans for basic survival. Life within Phalgunan’s sprawling *tharavad,* guarded by the massive iron gate was a story of struggle, for their daily *kanji* had more water in the meal than grain.

As he waited for the last speaker to finish, he noticed the midget Arjunan gesticulating fervently from the exit ladder. He wondered why he was even here in the first place, this far from home. Certainly, not good news, it spelt.

Minutes later, the midget confirmed it. The sharks had already sent a *final* notice two months ago against the default of payment. Now they had sent the “*collector”* home. The women inside refused to open the huge iron gate of the *tharavad*. They sent Arjunan, the newspaper boy to Idukki to fetch Phalgunan, the man, the leader.

The *collector* greeted Phalgunan with a resounding slap. The bystanders were too stunned to react. A leader belonging to the ruling party was being manhandled. There was something authoritative about the *collector*. Of course, the pistols looked genuine.

Hushed voices spoke about a political rivalry. Some guessed a family dispute. Only Phalgunan knew what they were after. If there was any option whereby, he could buy time.... He could not think anymore after the punch that broke his nose. He swayed and fell. A pair of hands dragged him up not giving him enough time to hold on to his dhoti that had slipped and fallen on the muddy road to his *tharavad*.

People followed, trotting at a safe distance, as the coterie moved towards the sprawling *tharavad*. No one had seen the inside so far, though there was gossip about Phalgunan’s beautiful teenaged daugthers being safeguarded inside as the huge iron gate had barricaded everything beyond. The villagers had nothing much to do these days anyway besides queuing up at the Public distribution shop or praying for the rains and this vicarious incident provided ample entertainment.

By now the c*ollector* had already taken out the key bunch and thrown away the black handbag that usually rested under Phalgunan’s armpits.

“No, No, No….” were the only words Phalgunan whimpered as he was dragged along.

The sound of the rusty lock disengaging evinced a gasp of apprehension as the secret world of Phalgunan unfolded with every budge of the huge solid iron gate.

There was a stunned silence as the gate fully opened to the villagers’ view. Phalgunan moved forward as the shocked collector eased his grip. The girls saw him and ran towards him leaving the body on the dilapidated veranda. He hugged them and cried. They dragged their way back to the body that had stopped frothing from the mouth. The empty pesticide bottle remained clasped on her left hand.

Phalgunan slid down to the floor holding on to the concrete wall of the *Tulasithara* for support. For a fleeting moment he thought he heard her prayers *“Deepam, Deepam”*as she gently placed the burning wick from the earthen lamp on the *Tulasithara* at sunset. The burnt wick was still there on the edge of the *Tulasithara.* He picked it up slowly and as if he remembered something, he searched for the printout and fished it out from his shirt pocket. He flipped to the side of the paper that was blank and took out his Pilot pen. He was trying to write.

The glide of the pen scripted a hollow story. The ink had run dry long ago!
