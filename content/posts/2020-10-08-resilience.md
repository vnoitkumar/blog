What is resilience if not the ability to take life as it comes, and to move on, strengthened by that very experience. It is also the ability to see a loved one deteriorate, fall apart … the one on whom your life depended, the one whose touch meant the difference between life and death for you, and yet live your life as if everything’s fine. One fine day, he doesn’t know who you are. One fine day, she brings her excreta to the drawing room … and your vision gets misty … it’s not a question of how do I manage this … it’s a question of how do I accept this pillar of my life collapsing before my eyes … will I be the same person after all this is over?

And Stephen Covey advises you: *We cannot choose what happens to us, we can choose our responses.*

At the other end of the spectrum stands Franz Kafka’s “Metamorphosis”, the short, power-packed story about a young man who turns into a large cockroach overnight (or dung beetle – according to whose translation you get!). His family is horrified and then saddened, and then ashamed and then disgusted. The son dies a victim of their neglect and … disgust.

See “The Fiddler On The Roof” and “Dr. Zhivago” for unconnected events and how they revive our resilience; see “Mother India”, for Poverty and Oppression and our will to go on; see “Gone With The Wind” for stupidity in relationships and say: Tomorrow’s another day! And look around for incompatible spouses living in quiet desperation …

The caregivers metamorphose. Like it or not. In unconscious ways. If the patient survives, his apparent willpower and mental strength are highlighted; if the patient does not survive, well, it was God’s will. This essay is an attempt to look at the “back-office” whose endurance, patience, mind-numbing efforts and the will to get on is hardly ever noticed, let alone recognized.

Recent writers have recorded their experiences of having lived through … and come away, defeated or victorious, level-headed or bipolar – the ability to “accept” is the key, perhaps. Others have conducted dispassionate, detached surveys, and analysed the effects on families that carry the burden of survival amidst despair, penury and helplessness, highlighting the economic ruin that comes out of most terminal illnesses like Cancer, Leprosy, TB (till recently), and the modern-day, age-related phenomena: Dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s. Then there’s mental retardation/disorders of various types – congenital and post-traumatic; schizophrenia, and AIDS and STD with their element of “shame”; and alcoholism with the inevitable humiliation and poverty – and police interference. But what about the mental and emotional drain-out?

*What happens when the warmth of the arms you ran into as a child,*

*(the love and the warmth that was so much “home”)*

*suddenly disappears*

*into eyes*

*that have gone*

*vacant,*

*a voice that is silenced or …*

*has become* 

*harsh and offensive,*

*When the amygdala spurs you to “flight”*

*For there's no scope of a “fight” here*

*Who will you fight with?*

*And there's no “flight”*

*Who will take care ..?*

*Suddenly, it is you who are the love-giver,*

*the pillar of strength….*

*that **you** have always longed for.*

\*that you long for **now***

*And you long … to end it all,*

*one way or another*

*the next instant*

*the guilt crushes you*

*into a gloom*

*and you can’t forgive yourself.*

*And when “it” does end,*

*one way or the other,*

*how do you cope?*

In 2019 there were 38 million living with HIV the world over (with 1.7 million new cases); 690,000 had died due to HIV. With 38 million **infected**, there would be nothing less than 160 million people, close relatives and dependents, **affected**.

In his novel, “***Em and The Big Hoom***” Jerry Pinto had provoked all these questions, emotions and more. In “***A Book of Light***”, as the editor, he explores the miserable ways in which people try to “cope”. It is a collection of thirteen stories of people with whom he found the “same hurts and vulnerabilities”, each with their own *distancing* devices, all challenging, terrifying, demanding of them all that they had, and then some.

The stories tell of compassion, deep angst, a longing for “freedom” mixed with irrepressible love and devotion which itself is inexplicable, under the circumstances – stories of mental illness, disturbance, alcoholism; some compounded with cancer or suicide. Each story highlights the deep connectedness that keeps humans together as families; where the ties that bind us go much deeper than any vows of support “in sickness and in health”. Each situation explores the relationships which deepen with time and patience (the word “patience”, incidentally, comes from the Latin word for “suffering”). There is a strong tendency towards mental depression in empathy with the respective families by the time one has finished reading the stories.

The stories bring out the “clumsy kindness” of friends and relatives; some remember the humour and the happy moments; most are troubled by a multitude of questions:

*What did I do that I shouldn’t have?*

*What did I not do that I ought to have?*

*How did I not notice this or that?*

*I wonder whether all he needed*

*was someone to open a window*

*somewhere*

*and throw him a blanket;*

*was that someone supposed to be me?*

And then there is the trauma of riots: where most people had no idea what it means to wake up one morning and find yourself cast as “the other”.  speaks of the horrendous forms of mutual annihilation that we are still engaged in. It describes a Sikh mother trying to locate her son …

*“And then the crowd moved back. A clearing sprung up in the centre and you could see the dance of fire, the dance of death, gruesome, macabre, brutal.”*

And one lives through that.

It speaks of a time when neighbours turn into unrecognisable monsters, and everything thereafter is looked at in terms of what happened when the chips were down. Worse still, the perpetrators take the conflict and its outcome as an affirmation of their primacy, not unlike the spoils of war. You could see it in the arrogance at the Babri Masjid in 1992, in the easy brutality of the Staines’ killing in 1999, and in the repeated atrocities towards the Dalits elsewhere in India... the book speaks of the dark period when the nation was plunged into diabolic revelry – a morning after, with a shameful hangover.

And then there’s that vain hope:

*If someone could just come by and be there,*

*sit quietly and offer companionship,*

*let you talk when you wanted to but let you be silent…*

*if that was what might help you deal… … …*

But, in the words of Samuel Beckett's Istrago (***Waiting For Godot***): "... Nothing happens. Nobody comes, nobody goes.”

And whether in disease, violence or oppression it is you! You have to survive. It is you who ensures that life must go on, come what may.
