Every time the train approached that station,

My heart pounded with an overwhelming happiness!

Even the wheels of the train skimmed with delight,

In par with my heart's rhythm!

The train swiftly changed the pace to give my eyes a glimpse of barren fields.

Then it plunged into a forest of Casuarina trees!

The silvery luminescent light from the moon illuminated the night!

And millions of stars adorned the pitch-dark sky!

This journey reflected the rhythm of life,

The highs and lows with a change in momentum!

Gone are the days when I exchanged words of love with him while I traveled in the same train.

As I got immersed in a sea of memories,

The train imperceptibly halted at my dearest station.

Deserted platform and closed shops were the only scene others could spot.

But my heart knew that he lived minutes away from that locale!

As the train made a blaring horn to continue its clickety-clack journey ,<!--

I continued reminiscing the good old times

Gazing through the window!
