Close to the city of Paithan, in a small village called Sauviragram, which lay along the banks of the great river Godavari, lived a woman named Ilaa. Being cotton farmers, her family was well to do but not among the richest in their area. It was the harvest season and cotton had to be picked from the plants. The wholesalers and traders from Paithan would be arriving in just a few weeks, carrying gold and goods for barter. They would exchange what they carried for the cotton that the farmers grew. The bales of cotton had to be ready in time! Work was at its peak!

But Ilaa was not found in the fields. She wasn’t working. Instead, she was sitting by the bank of the great river Godavari.

“I’m sick of this!” she grunted loudly.

“You make a pretty picture sitting there with your feet dangling in the water. Why this frown on your face?”

Ilaa was so caught up in her own frustration that she hadn’t noticed the young man come out of the water and walk towards her.

“Pray! Who may you be and what business is it of yours,” she asked still frowning.

“Amjad Khan at your service, ma’am,” he said making an elaborate aadaab.

“Where did you pop up from,” she asked.

“I didn’t pop up. You did,” he said smiling,“I was enjoying the cool waters of the Godavari when you suddenly appeared. I didn’t know if it was all right for me to be here talk to a local damsel.”

“Well! You did, didn’t you?”

“I couldn’t hold my breath under water any longer,” he said laughing. Ilaa smiled. Amjad wasn’t really a man, perhaps sixteen, with a handsome face, curly hair and a very engaging smile.

“So what’s the problem,” he asked.

“I’m just fed up,” Ilaa said. “You’re not a local. Who are you,” she asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

“I’m an artisan at Badshaah Aurangzeb’s court,” he said.

“What are you doing here,” she asked.

“It’s a long story. Do you know that Malik Ambar Saheb, the architect of Aurangabad city is building a Panchakki in Paithan? I volunteered to come and work on it.”

“Yes, I’ve heard that it’s an engineering marvel but no one seems to know too much about it,” Ilaa said.

“There was the need for a chakki to grind grain for the pilgrims and saints who visited Paithan and for the troops. But how do you find something strong enough to move the blades of such a large chakki? The solution – water!”

“Water?”

“Yes, water. We are building a maze of underground earthenware pipes starting from a mountain spring a long distance away. The water will be sent to masonry tanks which when full will flow down from a great height like a waterfall. The force of this water will move the blades of the chakki.”

“Oh! How I wish I could see it,” Ilaa said sighing. There was so much going on in the world outside and she was sitting here in this God-forsaken village.

“Come over at any time. I’ll show you around,” Amjad said grandly.

“But I can’t understand why an artisan should decide to do masonry work,” Ilaa mused.

“I am here with a purpose. My younger sister Fauzia was an apprentice with a specialist weaver of muslin cloth. Badshaah Aurangzeb is simply fascinated with your Paithani silk – the way they weave the same pattern onto both sides of the cloth. He has sent a number of weavers here to learn the art and Fauzia was forced to come with them even though we felt she was too young to leave home. I’m hoping to somehow make contact and keep an eye on her.”

“I’ll help you,” Ilaa said enthusiastically.

“How can *you* help me,” he said in an off-hand manner.

“See. The same supercilious attitude of all men! O.k, tell me, why have you come to Sauviragram?”

“I heard the word mentioned in connection with the Paithani weavers,” and as realization dawned, he asked, “Are they here? Do you know where?”

“I can find out,” she replied calmly.

They heard a voice shouting, “Ilaa-----Ilaa------aa,” and a strapping young Maratha came into view.

“Oh! There you are. Everyone was searching for you. I knew where you would be and came straight here. Who’s this?”

“He’s Amjad Khan from Paithan,” she replied.

\*\*\*\*

“Will you marry me, Ilaa,” Mahadev asked. I know I’m a dud and you are educated ----------.”

“Huh! Great use, being educated! In the Vedic age women were educated and were equal to men in every way. They were respected as scholars, educationists, physicians, warriors, even purohits. And we? Educated, but put to no practical use. Cook, serve, work in the fields – that’s our life. And, who said you’re a dud, Mahadev? You are doing everything that all the other men- folk are doing. Let me tell you, you are the nicest human being I have met in my life. If the families arrange it, I’d love to marry you,” she said with conviction.

As they walked home, Ilaa told Mahadev about Amjad Khan and about the panchakki. They discussed various things. She had some ideas and he, a few of his own. Finally, they came to an understanding. “Just ask for Do Bigha Zameen,” she said as they parted.

\*\*\*\*

On most evenings the men got together in Ilaa’s house to enjoy a glass of the local toddy. Ilaa’s father was a very genial man and a courteous host. The Sarpanch particularly was very close to the family. Being a widower, he often stayed on to partake of their evening meal.

“Uncle, it seems weavers from Aurangzeb’s court have come here to learn Paithani weaving,” Ilaa said casually.

“Yes, they are here. What of it?”

“Uncle, take us all to see them at work. Please uncle. We are working all the time. Take us on a picnic after the harvest is over. Please uncle,” she beseeched him.

“Ok beti, let me see,” he replied.

One week after the last bale of cotton had been loaded on to a cart and sent on its way, a large group of villagers, mainly women, went to see the Paithani weavers at work. A long row of bullock carts wound their way along the side of a hill and arrived at a small village. Everywhere, looms had been set up and people were at work. The chief of the village took them around to see the astounding colours, the beautiful designs – the bright peacock, the delicate lotus and the coconut borders. “Badshaah Aurangzeb has introduced these new delicate motifs,” the chief said, pointing to a group of women weaving simple flowers in delicate hues, intricate roses, tulips and flowering vines.

“Are these materials for sale,” the zamindar’s wife enquired. “No. They are only for the Badshaah’s court. If anyone dares

to sell these materials, he has ordered that their hands be cut off.”

Ilaa’s eyes were darting here and there in search of Fauzia. How would she recognize her? How would she not recognize her! There she was – a spit image of Amjad himself. Casually moving towards her, she sat down as if observing her at work and whispered, “Don’t react. Amjad is here in Paithan.” As if enquiring about her work, Ilaa spoke to Fauzia in a soft voice. Listening to her intently, Fauzia nodded her head and smiled. After getting the chief’s permission, she gave Ilaa a small piece of silk with a lotus woven on it.

\*\*\*\*

When Amjad met Ilaa on the banks of the Godavari the next time – “In two months, Fauzia will be back home. Mark my words,” Ilaa announced dramatically but refused to provide an explanation.

\*\*\*\*

“O.k, give me the barren land near the hillock at the end of our property” Mahadev begged. His father did not have the heart to deny him even that. He loved his youngest son dearly. Let him amuse himself doing whatever he wants with that piece of land. I’ll allot a dozen workers to him to make him feel important, he thought.

While the rest of the village was taking it easy after the harvest, young Mahadev went to work. First he fenced his land. His father smiled to himself. Then he had neat channels dug in equidistant straight lines from the lower end to the top of the hillock. The villagers wondered what he was up to. Then, he had his workers sow cotton seeds at equal distances in the channels. By now the villagers were laughing at him. He then set about building a large wooden gate. Every alternate rafter of wood ended in a sharp triangle and protruded out by almost one foot. Through all this Ilaa spent some time with Mahadev every day, occasionally sharing his lunch. In the meantime, the workers connected all the smaller channels to a larger canal that reached the end of the property near the river. The wooden gate was placed here and a small stream flowing near the property was diverted to the wooden gate. With great fan-fare, Mahadev and Ilaa with their workers partly lifted the gate and water came rushing through the gaps. They had made a sluice gate. The force of the water from the river helped in pushing the water through the canal to the smaller channels. By afternoon, water had reached every seed in the field. By lifting and lowering the sluice gate, they could control the amount of water reaching their saplings. The villagers were stunned. While they had been waiting for the rains to plant their seeds, Mahadev had found a means to harvest one more crop!

Mahadev’s cotton had been plucked and the yield was very good. The bales were ready for the market, but who would buy cotton now? It was not the cotton selling season. One fine morning three bullock carts trundled up to Mahadev’s house. A trader had come for the cotton. Amjad Khan was driving the first bullock cart. Mahadev and Ilaa had kept in touch with him and he had promised to get them a buyer and here he was. The trader was a man who did business with the British. After completing his purchase he assured Mahadev that he was ready to buy cotton at any time of the year, as the British were spreading their net for cotton, far and wide.

\*\*\*\*

“Fauzia is back home,” Amjad said, handing over a small packet to Ilaa. “This is a small gift for you. Muslin, her speciality. Wear it for your wedding. What did you do? She won’t tell me. Just laughs when I ask.”

“Brains over brawn, young man,” Ilaa said grinning. “I did nothing. Just gave her a bit of advice. So, she started falling ill, first occasionally and then more and more often till they found that she was more of a nuisance than a help and sent her home. We just spread the act over a two month period so that it would look very natural.”

“I bow to the woman’s superior mind,” Amjad said, astonished at how simple and effective the whole plan was. He was desperately trying to work out a plan to spirit her away!

Mahadev handed over a small bag with a few gold coins to Amjad. “This is your share of the profits, Amjad. You inspired us to achieve this goal.”

“Me?”

“Yes, you – by explaining to us in such detail about the panchakki.”

“My work,” Amjad said proudly and handed a small soapstone model to Mahadev. It was an exquisite piece of workmanship, a perfect miniature of Humayun’s tomb. “Since work on the panchakki is progressing briskly now, I have been called back to continue my work in the Badshah’s capital.”

As Amjad climbed on to the bullock cart, he waved out to them and called out, “I shall be back my friends.”

\*\*\*\*

The Sarpanch called for a panchayat meeting. He praised Mahadev for his achievements. Serious discussions were held on how to improve everyone’s cotton growing capacity. Mahadev then spoke. “The British are now ready to buy as much cotton as we can sell them – any quantity. It is being said that they are inventing big machines that can weave large quantities of cotton cloth in no time at all. While this is good for us cotton growers, we must not forsake our own weavers and sell all our cotton to the British. We must not be greedy. We must stand united – care for our own.”

My son has come into his own, Mahadev’s father thought proudly, looking at his son.

“I also want to say that this whole venture was Ilaa’s idea. I could never have done any of this on my own. I only executed it, which makes us true partners.” He took a deep breath and before he lost his nerve, he quickly blurted out, “Also, I am going to marry Ilaa.” There was a stunned silence for a minute after which everyone started talking at the same time.

\*\*\*\*

Monsoon season. A torrential downpour. Two figures with gunny sacks covering their heads ran towards the end of Mahadev’s property and opened the sluice gate partially. The river in this season was teeming with fish being carried downstream from the upper reaches. With the sluice gate open, a large number of them were carried along, filled the canal and started flowing into some of the smaller channels. When the rain stopped, Ilaa and Mahadev had harvested baskets and baskets of fresh fish.

“What a great idea you had Mahadev. I would never have made the connection between the fish and the water channels. My hero,” Ilaa said, linking her arm through his.

Distributing the fish to all the families in the village, Mahadev said, “Now, that was a really large catch. Next we have to figure out how to market fish! Together! Equality Ilaa? Even in this era?”
