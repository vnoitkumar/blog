preposterous this claim of being immortal 

impossible they haughtily said

none can defy us they said with a chortle 

when Rome says you’re dead, you’re dead

so how can this young man dare to defy

the might and the power of Rome

how dare he refuse to lie down and die

vacate his tomb and roam

what will become of our law they shout

how keep a hold on our slaves

if all the young men our orders did flout

and walked gingerly out of their graves
