I'm a very nice person, but I'm not strong,\
In a nut shell that’s what's wrong\
with me.\
You see,\
I'll do anything to avoid a fight,\
And this, even when I know I'm right.\
\
The terrible anxiety, the tension, the strife\
Is caused by not coming to terms with life\
I know,\
And so,\
Instead of spreading my wings and trying to fly,\
I only want to curl up in bed and try to die.\
\
I seem to forego things I want with amazing ease,\
I bend backwards quite unnecessarily to please,\
Which I shouldn't do.\
It is also true\
That I suffer from guilt even when I haven't done anything wrong,\
Anyone can see that these are not signs of being mentally strong.\
\
I seem to have lost a lot of my good qualities on the way.\
I used to continually converse with god, now I occasionally pray,\
Which is bad.\
It's also sad\
That while I could always laugh and crack a joke,\
I've now turned into a muddled, silent, uninteresting bloke.\
\
When slapped, Jesus turned the other cheek,\
Yet people recognized that he was not weak,\
That he was strong.\
Where I've been wrong\
Is in treating other people’s weaknesses as mine too,\
When actually, I possess a rare strength recognised by few.\
\
I'm flexible, I may bend backwards, but I will not break,\
On this my life I am willing to stake,\
For I still see,\
Deep within me,\
That inner core strength known as tenacity.\
Isn't it time I started putting my faith in it implicitly?\
\
Recognition is the first step towards resurrection!
