***The ability to fight back, when a disease or affliction has overtaken you, is not an easy one. This is the story of Sudha, my brother’s wife and her Resilience.***

***Sudha, during those days was a HR professional in my brother’s organization headquartered in Chennai with offices all over the globe. Armed with flair and impeccable art of communication, she was a live wire at work. Yet, she found time to unwind with young children with her own unique and entertaining ways of mentoring, grooming and guiding their future.***

***She was in the pink of her health with no known ailments or undesirable health parameters when on a routine visit to the parlour, she collapsed on the salon chair. I remember this vividly, when the news struck me like a lightning on the 24th of November 2014.***

***Helping hands at the parlour ensured that she got immediate medical attention in a prominent clinic, which probably saved her, but the stroke had left the right side of her body paralyzed and left brain severely affected. Doctors informed us that the massive stroke had left her with a condition called “APHASIA”, in medical parlance, a communication disorder due to brain damage.***

***Sooner, it was her 50th birthday which we solemnly celebrated in prayers to the almighty to stand with her through her resilience and give us back the Sudha we used to know.***

***Days passed. Still confined to bed, she regained consciousness after a few days. But she was literally born again, new to the world, terrified and mystified at the happenings around her. She was speech impaired and had to be assisted for every single physical activity. There were angels around her in the form of close family members and friends who were available round the clock, identifying and tending to her needs.***

***In this life event, Sudha yet remains the sole hero. If not for her unforgiving resilience, she would not have got out of that bed.***

***She unfailingly attended her physiotherapy sessions, speech and vision therapies, hoping that she will be back to her old self one day, some day!. In her despairing condition, she never missed traveling to Chicago to an institute that specializes on rehabilitating Aphasia stricken people. She had to endure this long travel twice a year.***

***She deeply believed that her resilience will prevail. Resilience was the only weapon she carried through this phase incredibly and recover most of her lost abilities.***

***Six years down the road, I look back at the transformation. Yes, she is not yet 100% normal, physically. Her right hand is barely functional. She has a pronounced limp in her steps. She stutters while speaking. She, however, has adapted brilliantly in utilizing her left hand for her chores and writing.***

***Her memory has returned stronger and intact. A brilliant driver in those good old days, she misses driving around the crowded lanes of Chennai. Yet, today, she can guide any expert driver to get around any nook and corner of her city.***

***The pandemic that has crippled the world doesn’t deter Sudha. She continues her therapies through online sessions, despite the strain that wears her out.***

***Many would have given up, diving into deep depression and self-pity. Sudha, being Sudha cannot be defeated so easily, even a life-threatening medical condition cannot stand up to her Resilience. A living fighter to champion the cause “We shall overcome”.***
