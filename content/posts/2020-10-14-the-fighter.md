***The ability to fight back, when a disease or affliction has overtaken you, is not an easy one. My brother’s wife Sudha is a standing example of “Resilience”.***

***She was Head (HR) in by brother’s organization based in Chennai with branches all over India and abroad. She had excellent communication skill and could move comfortably with people of all ages right from Children and engage them too.***

***Sudha is a healthy person with no history of BP, Sugar or Cholesterol. All of sudden, precisely six years back, on November 26,2014, she collapsed while she was in a beauty parlor, where she went to trim her hair. Luckily, the parlor staff could inform my brother immediately and she was shifted to a City famous hospital. The doctors’ said that the next 48 hours was critical, and only after that, the extent of damage, shall be known. She suffered a major stroke affecting her right side completely and leaving her left brain affected. Immediate medical attention, without loss of time, which is very essential, got her back to us. Her 50th birthday was only few days away.***

***Doctors informed us that the massive stroke had left her with a condition called “APHASIA”, in medical parlance. It is a communication disorder due to brain damage. She was bed ridden and slowly gained consciousness. Yet speech was nil. She had completely forgotten simple day to day activities like brushing teeth to bathing, gargling, and sneezing out. Everything had to be taught to her afresh.***

***Now, she limps while walking, but use of right hand is still very minimal. Communication is still a problem too. Although, her mind works fine and thought process is good, putting the words together and forming a sentence is still difficult. Her right vision was a problem too. Thanks to my brother’s strong support, encouragement and his efforts to make her be accepted in all the social gatherings, coupled with her determination to fight, she took up vision therapy, physio therapy, and speech therapy. Twice a year, she was taken to Chicago in US, where rehabilitation is done for such disorders caused by Aphasia, (a month’s course). Vision was corrected slowly.***

***Even today, during pandemic, she continues her speech therapy, physio therapy on line session, for 5 days a week. Too much of strain tires her.***

***In God’s creation, when one part fails to function, the other takes over. Now she does all her daily chores like eating, and bathing and writing with her left hand and she does it all too well. As far memory is concerned, it is very strong and she remembers all the incidents in her life. She used to drive car effortlessly. Now although she is not able to drive, she can guide you to various places.***

***Any average person, would have given up and would have fallen into deep depression and would be consumed in self-pity. But she is a standing example for everyone and has been fighting it out to overcome her conditions to get back to normal. I can only say “three cheers to Sudha”. Let almighty God shower his choicest blessings on the couple.***
