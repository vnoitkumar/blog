She held her head in despair. The noises were growing louder. She could hear it all night. She was afraid. There was the sound of a train running through a tunnel. A never-ending tunnel. Would it ever see the light of day?

They were always talking about her. She could hear them whispering. They were planning something. They wanted to incriminate her in something. She could not fathom what it was. But she would not allow that. She decided to stay in her room and not see anyone.

She lived in a small room with a tiny window that would hardly let in any light. She preferred that. She did not want the light in her eyes. She kept the window shut most of the time and sat in darkness while the noises in her head grew louder and louder.

It was then she started seeing figures. They were dancing around her and mocking her.

She heard thunder. She crouched in the corner of the room. It was raining. She paced up and down the room. She could not sit still even for a little while. Sleep evaded her. She looked at herself in the mirror. A stranger seemed to be looking at her. It looked as if her hair had not been combed for days on end. Her clothes were disheveled, and it had food stains all over it.

She could not remember if she had a bath that morning. Had she changed her clothes?

The room was in a mess. Newspapers boarded up against one door. She was afraid to dispose of the garbage, so it lay in heaps all over the place.

The phone was ringing. She did not dare to pick it up. It could be the police. She wanted help. She had always been a loner. She did not trust people and regarded with suspicion any friendly overtures, and hence preferred to remain aloof.

She drifted away from the people she knew. She discouraged visits and phone calls.

Slowly she alienated from most people she knew. She became rude to people who wanted to help her, so they left her to her own designs.

Soon lethargy crept upon her. She did not want to want to step out of the room. She skipped office. She hardly cooked. Her appetite diminished. She ate very little, she did almost nothing the whole day, she stopped reading and she stared into vacant space day after day while the noises in her head grew louder and louder. The cacophony was unbearable. She was in a world of her own. She lived in fear. Fear of noises and fear of frightening figures.

The doorbell rang. She froze. Should she open it? With her heart beating wildly she opened it a fraction. It was not the police.

It was a cousin who loved her dearly.

"Why did she come”?

"What was she doing here"?

Her cousin tried to embrace her. She shrugged her off. She did not feel any emotion towards her. Her cousin started packing some clothes She was putting them in a bag. Why was she doing that she wondered! They were dirty and had to be washed. Her cousin was saying that they had to go somewhere.

She did not want to go anywhere. She resisted. She had to be forced into the vehicle.

They travelled a long distance. She was restless all through the journey. She wanted to go back. She protested incessantly with incoherent muttering. Nothing would pacify her, neither words of consolation nor words of anger. It was a journey fret with tension and fear. When at last they reached their destination, she was worn out and had become quite docile. The person they saw was very kind to her. He asked her a lot of questions which she did not want to answer.

They were returning now. Her cousin was helping her to have a bath, she then gave her something to eat and after that she was giving her medicines. She started listening to her cousin.

They made regular visits to that place. She realized that it was a hospital, and that kind person was a physician. After several visits and several courses of medicine she realized that she was not seeing anymore frightening figures. The voices and the whispering continued.

Days and months passed. The noises in her head were no longer so loud. The whispering had almost ceased. Then one day as she was passing her neighbor’s door, she strained to hear something, anything, but there was only silence.

A kind of sweet, heavenly blissful silence.
