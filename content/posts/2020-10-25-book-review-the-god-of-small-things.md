*The God of Small Things*, Arundhati Roy’s first novel, came to me as a Christmas gift in 1998, during my wanderings in the interior of India – from the Principal of a Kendriya Vidyalaya. She had won the Man Booker Prize the previous year, he informed me.

I started reading the book rather reluctantly (these prizes mean nothing!) … but I had a surprise. It has that gurgle somewhere at the base of the throat all the time, not quite surfacing – but jumping out in a guffaw now and then, unexpectedly, irrepressibly, intellectually satisfying; the near-flippancy on which the events flow along, raising serious suspicions of attention deficiency, accentuated by the constant shift of time and place; and the subtle transference of the narration between Rahel, the seven-year-old protagonist, and the author-narrator.

How much of the book is autobiographical, is an interesting question.

Arundhati was born in Shillong to Mary Roy (a Syrian Christian, women’s rights worker from Kerala) and Rajib Roy (a Hindu, tea-plantation manager from Kolkata, working in present-day Meghalaya); they divorced, and Arundhati shifted to Kottayam, Kerala, with her mother and brother. The part-time protagonist, Rahel, has a somewhat similar history.

There *is* a river called Meenachal near Ayemenem/Aymanam. 

Arundhati’s brother, Lalit Kumar Christopher Roy, is the “LKC, who, like me, survived” who figures in the dedication. He is 18 months elder to Arundhati. Rahel has a zygotic twin-brother, called Estha, who arrived 18 *minutes* before her!

Arundhati went on to Lawrence School in the Nilgiris, and then to the School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi. Rahel also studies Architecture in Delhi and then moves to the US hoping to find peace, happiness, reconciliation with herself.

Rahel, in fact, is on constant search for love – where “no one else can lay down who should be loved. And how. And how much.” Her mother tells her that she loves her a little less for having burst out with a thoughtless remark. A moth, sitting on her heart, symbolises her emotional reactions, the feeling of being loved a little less. The moth relates to her grandfather, an Imperial Entomologist, who preserved a specimen of a moth that he had discovered but was not given the credit for.

Estha (short for Esthappen) has been on a self-effacing exercise from early childhood. He learns how to merge with the background and be unseen; along the way his stops speaking altogether.

The narrative flits between events from 1969 to 1993. In this period, between Rahel and the narrator we hear of the living-style of the grandparents (Pappachi, the wife-beater, and Mammachi who played classical western music on her violin); the unrequited love of a great-aunt (Baby Kochamma) for an Irish missionary; the daring attempts of a divorced mother to find love and sexual gratification in a dreaded relationship with a “paravan”; the accidental death of a nine-year-old, half-English cousin; an uncle going to and returning from Oxford; and the death of the “paravan” at the hands of the police for crimes he wasn’t even aware of. In the process of relating these sub-stories we see the state of the family as it exists in feudal Kerala through the pseudo-communist transformation, and beyond. And yet, when the father of the errant “paravan” discovers the forbidden relationship, he, in subconscious furtherance of a long history of subservience, promises to kill his own son. Ironically, it is the son’s visit to a place called “History House” that proved fatal. 

In the mean time, the twins, two distraught halves of a composite soul, have been travelling somewhat aimlessly until they return “home”. All through the book, interspersed among the events, Rahel and Estha are shown as inseparable, one as a part of the other.

A few examples would suffice (there are many more)

*“They never did look much like each other, Estha and Rahel. … there was none of the usual ‘Who is who?’ or ‘Which is which?’ … …The confusion lay in a deeper, more secret place.”*



*“She remembers (though she hadn’t been there) what the Orangedrink Lemondrink Man did to Estha …”*



*“She remembers the taste of the tomato sandwiches –* Estha’s *sandwiches, that* Estha *ate … on the Madras Mail to Madras.”*



*“It had been quiet in Estha’s head until Rahel came. But with her she had brought the sound of passing trains, and the light and shade that falls on you if you have a window seat. The world, locked out for years, suddenly flooded in …”*



*“\[Rahel] could feel the rhythm of Estha’s rocking, and the wetness of rain on his skin. She could hear the raucous, scrambled world inside his head.”*



*“Rahel never wrote to him* \[about their mother’s death]*. There are things that you can’t do – like writing letters to a part of yourself. To your feet or hair. Or heart.”*



So when the two of them meet in the end and the realise that

*They had known each other before Life began.*

*... Only that Quietness* \[Estha] *and Emptiness* \[Rahel] *fitted together like stacked spoons.*

*… Only that they held each other close, long after it was over,*

it was not a case of incest, as presumed by many readers I have met.

This scene, in my opinion, actually pulls the book out of the ordinary, justifying all the acclamation Arundhati received. She was talking about the two halves of the soul, wandering around the universe in search of that perfect communion; and when they find each other, it's like: *They had known each other before Life began*

I was reminded, then, of Eliot's “Four Quartets";

“And the end of all our exploring

Will be to arrive where we started

And know the place for the first time.”

It is in this context that the frontispiece assumes profound significance:

"Never again will a single story be told as though it's the only one." John Berger (1926-2017)

In a final burst of adulation, I would like to quote from the novel itself. Listen to Arundhati speak of the art of the Kathakali dancer enacting the Great Stories from the Mahabharata:

*..he handles \[the story] as he would a child of his own. He teases it. He punishes it. He sends it up like a bubble. He wrestles it to the ground and lets it go again. He laughs at it because he loves it. He can fly you across whole worlds in minutes, he can stop for hours to examine a wilting leaf. Or play with a sleeping monkey's tale. He can turn effortlessly from the carnage of war into the felicity of a woman washing her hair in a mountain stream. From the crafty ebullience of the rakshasa with a new idea into a gossipy Malayali with a scandal to spread. From the sensuousness a woman with the baby at her breast into the seductive mischief of Krishna’s smile. He can reveal the nugget of sorrow that happiness contains. The hidden fish of shame in a sea of glory.*

This, without doubt, is the essence of the art of storytelling perfected by Arundhati Roy.

I have just started reading her second novel, ”The Ministry of Utmost Happiness” published in 2017, and it’s promising to be a different experience altogether!
