‘To sleep, perchance, to dream,’ I quoted\
The first time that we met … and parted;\
Asked she of me with a perplexed glance,\
‘What mean you when you say perchance?’\
My sleep, my dreams and all, … departed.

The meeting was a formal one\
With nothing really said or done\
Her father ventured on and on\
On a virtual speech-a-mara-thon\
Of something that he thought was fun.

The mother was not far behind,\
Or shouldn’t I be so darned unkind,\
As to mention her presumptuous tries\
To get in a word or two, edge-wise,\
Of anecdotes that came to mind?

For me thus, there was ne’er a shred\
Of hope of getting anything said,\
Between me and the hopeful bride,\
Up front, in whispers or e’en ‘aside’\
Since the parents ranted on as said.

When the twin-verbal diarrhea was finally done,\
I said it was my turn for fun\
Through Gettysburg then, verbatim,\
And several ‘Churchills’, seriatim,\
I regaled ‘em till they did me stun!

Stunned me indeed, ‘twas all very sad:\
With “storm clouds a-gathering” – the floods that they had;\
And “some chicken, some neck” – they’d put in the stew.\
Afraid if I stayed on, I certainly knew\
I’d do something that would be very, very, bad.

To Macduff imagined, I cried: “Hold, enough!\
Dear sir and dear madam, with respect, let me off!\
Dear Churchill has lost, Wellington would too\
If he had you opp’site at ol’ Waterloo!\
I’m the kind that gets going, when the going gets tough.

Going ‘way from the fight is all that I wanted,\
I was going away, defeated and daunted,\
And when heard I that scary response\
On my star-cornered hope of dreaming ‘perchance’\
With Hamlet’s soliloquy I am, till date, haunted… …
