The flowers in the glass, so proudly they stand,

The glass looks down, and preens;

The vase in disdain doth dismiss it off-hand:

“What’s glass …to my porcelain genes!”

But the fact is, the glass has the flowers, my dear,

And you, the Aristo, hath none!

“Harrumph” arose from its deep interior

While the glass made a tinkling return.

The vase then noticed the stalk at its side,

So near, yet out of its reach;

Its empty insides did gnaw at its pride

But it wouldn’t do at all to beseech!

I’d rather be hungry, my rights I’ll abjure!

Let the glass hold all the flowers it can!

Tomorrow will show that class does endure

That glass is a cheap, one-night stand.
