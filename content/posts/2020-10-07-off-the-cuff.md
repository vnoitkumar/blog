**Off-the-cuff**

Does it walk

this graceful thing

of flower and of feather,

or float along

and o'er the stones

in any kind of weather?

perhaps it leaps,

or pirouettes

like a ballerina on stage?

or swish around

in liquid moves

like a mermaid come of age?

If "Moses" could be

bid to speak

as did ol' Michelangelo

who made the Papal seat

to float

o'er St Peter's sacred floor,

Why can't this rooted fruited beaut

get up and dance with me?

Like Pygmalion,

e'en Orpheus ...

in a new mythology?
