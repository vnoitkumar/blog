What is the source of my dreams ,\
Wherein lies the pot of gold ,\
The vast macrocosm beyond our reach ,\
Boundless curiosity ,\
Quagmire in my mind\
\
Fantasy and reality ,\
Providence or fortuity,\
Ennui and indulgence ,\
Like a streak of lightning ,\
Invade the mind\
\
Leaves rustling in orchestral harmony ,\
Nature's multi-faceted splendour ,\
Stars shining bright ,\
Dark arenas in spatial serenity ,\
Sensed by my mind\
\
The mountains in resplendent green,\
Thickets enchantingly deep ,\
The silver stream meandering through in the sunlight ,\
Nature's accoutrements these ,\
Gauged by my mind.
