**By Padmini**

(An Acrostic Poem)

**T**here you are, my child!

**H**ere, arrange these flowers

**E**legantly in the vase.

**S**he frowned as mother left the room,

**T**wo vases standing side by side

**O**ne of glass , the other a lovely ceramic white,

**R**ather odd together, she always thought,

**Y**ou could place one somewhere else, eh what?

**O**ne she filled with some lovely blooms

**F**or the white vase, the stems she started to prune.

**T**he tinkling sound of a cycle bell, she heard,

**H**appiness through her heart surged,

**E**very thought of the flowers left behind,

**W**ith one swift movement on his cycle she sat

**H**urry, before my mother comes back

**I**'ll pedal as fast as the wind dear, said he,

**T**hrough the gate and down the valley

**E**nding up at their favourite oak tree.

**V**ast blue sky forming a canopy above with little white clouds puffing along,

**A** beautiful green carpet with pretty peeping flowers,

**S**uch a wonderful sight to behold, a gentle breeze,

**E**nchanting meeting place for a pair of young lovers.

**B**eholden to each other until eternity

**Y**oung love, everything meant with sincerity.

**P**utting aside thoughts of mother and home

**A**ware of the daring he had shown,

**D**arling, what IS that, smilingly asked she,

**M**uffins, peppermints and a flask of tea!

**I**ntertwined fingers, they walked to their favourite nook,

**N**estled together facing the gurgling brook.

**I**mmersed in the intense joy of first love's look.
