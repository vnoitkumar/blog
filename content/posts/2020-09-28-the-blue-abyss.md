Gazing at the beautiful blue abyss\
Only to be consumed by its eternal bliss\
The gushing of waves like it were a song\
A discerning place, here is where I belong\
The sea is a world where time seems to cease\
Awakening an intense sense of calm and peace\
Looking out into the seamless horizon\
Like it holds a million dreams to be spun\
In wonder what its depths would hold\
For those who dare to its vastness behold\
My heart and mind were in perfect balance\
As though there was a guiding presence\
Realising that this creation is a masterpiece\
Comes to only those who truly seek.
