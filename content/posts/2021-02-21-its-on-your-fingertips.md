  Fingerprints on Stanley Sundays

Many a criminal would have gone Scot-free if it wasn’t for dactyloscopy (I looked that up!), the study of fingerprints at the scene of the crime. It is understood that the ancient Babylonians used fingerprints as “signatures” on documents (clay tablets) – although it is doubtful if they were aware of their uniqueness to the individual. Those little squiggles on your fingertips have now found a better use. Called by an unlikely name, dermatoglyphics, it helps in an area of much parental anxiety these days: career guidance, hobby selection, and … parenting!

Three basic finger-print patterns have been identified as shown in the diagram below.

Each of these patterns has several sub-types (see the box), and these appear in an infinite number of combinations on the ten fingers of human beings. Each individual is thus bound to have a very unique combination of whorls and loops and arches – a fact that has been established beyond doubt by criminal law and practice.

Dermatoglyphics, however, goes on to describe the characteristics of the person depending of each pattern, and the particular finger on which it is found. A whorl found on the right thumb, for instance, indicates above-average intelligence and leadership qualities while a loop would mean average intelligence and a tendency to go with the flow. An arch, which is less frequently found, indicates an analytical mind, difficult to get along with, and the need for mentors. Any pattern on the thumb shows the kind of “personality” you’re dealing with; if the right thumb (which reflects a focus on oneself) carries a whorl, it would show a highly focussed individual, goal-oriented, strong-willed and persistent – but may be perceived by others as stubborn, individualistic/egoistic and/or blunt. The same pattern on the left thumb would be indicative of a more people-centred leader who flourishes on interpersonal skills.

A thumb or finger could have any of the twenty-odd patterns. The index finger, connected with the “frontal lobe”, controls the Thinking Process (Logic and Visualisation), the middle finger, connected with the “parietal lobe”, depicts the Energy Zone (Motor skills), the ring finger, connected with the “temporal lobe”, carries the Communication Zone (Verbal and Non-verbal) and the little finger, connected with the “occipital lobe”, caters to the Observation Zone (Physical sight and Aesthetic senses). Of course, the parts are not like water-tight chambers; there’s constant, nano-second, interaction among the lobes and the millions of neurons.

Anthropologists and Neuro-scientists would have their say about the use of the “opposing” thumb in humans (in their study of “grips” particularly) being linked with the pre-frontal lobe vis-à-vis simians who do not have the pre-frontal cortex and, therefore, a limited use of the thumb – but that’s a much bigger story.

It is important to note, however, that dermatoglyphics does not restrict itself to the measurement of “intelligence” as in IQ; it extends itself to Emotional Quotient, Creativity Quotient, Adversity Quotient and so on. With this “multiple intelligence” identification and analysis, the knowledge gained about, say, a child, can be used effectively since parents and teachers are then aware of the child’s potential in particular areas; children can also be assisted in the selection of appropriate hobbies, careers, and the appropriate study method (the analysis will also show which method of teaching a child responds best to: Visual, Auditory or Kinaesthetic, or a combination thereof). For adults, it could help in self-management as it identifies the “Core Competencies and Major Limitations” of an individual. And insofar as this is scientifically determined, it forms a solid basis for future course of action. Consider, for instance, the career counselling given to students at present: it is based on the subjective observations of the teacher and/or parents, and their limited knowledge about the career options available; a rough kind of matching is done. 

[Dermatoglyphics, on the other hand, draws its scientific base from Neuroscience, Genetics, Psychology and Embryology. In fact, it is an interdisciplinary approach that studies the neural underpinnings in our cognitive abilities and includes perception, memory, reasoning, attention, self-awareness, motor control, language and consciousness: what each of us possess in different ratios, unique combinations. Once this is discovered, parents/teachers will not force children to get into courses of study and careers that do not hold any interest for the children, or where their personalities do not match with the requirements of the chosen profession. Of course, the analysis of the findings needs to be communicated to the parents and the child in a manner that will not amount to demotivating for the child.](<>)

Such analysis is useful also to employers – whether in recruitment or in assignment of responsibilities. The results are certainly more accurate than the assumptive IQ tests which concentrates on the left-brain function, and the results can be quite demeaning, disheartening and demotivating. Those who fare “badly” in a particular IQ test could have been affected by “anxiety” or other emotional factor at the time of the test – and therefore the output would be “below normal”. There is serious re-thinking on the correctness of using “one unifying score … to determine a person’s overall ability”. It was believed earlier that, though there are different kinds of “intelligence”, they were influenced by one, dominant type of intelligence which the IQ test essentially tried to measure. But more recent research has shown that the human brain actually accommodates many specialised sub-systems – which cannot be identified, or classified, under any single, over-arching system.

This article would not be complete without a mention of a group of psychologists who decry the scientific claims of dermatoglyphics…which only goes to prove that the brain is another of those elusive frontiers of science that seem to slip further and further away as we think we are getting closer … …
