A haunting melody wafted in through my window. It held a strange, melancholy note that irresistibly drew me to it. I was mesmerised. I rushed to the window but could see nobody there. The music changed to a soulful old Hindi film song. The pathos in his music fascinated me. The beauty of music born from the stark emptiness of the bamboo instrument? I sat by the window and listened to him for the next few minutes, slowly sipping my cup of tea. The music suddenly stopped. Perhaps he was tired of blowing his life breath into his beloved wooden flute? The legend of Krishna - I wondered if he had heard about it? Or was he only trying hard to eke out a living with the only skill he has?

I walked out to the road thinking, and unconsciously looking for the flute player. The vehicles whizzed past me. The roadside vegetable and fruit vendors sat with their wares, calling out to the pedestrians. The roadside food lane was buzzing with people and the busy vendors who, with their makeshift stoves and wooden carts were doling out hot food. Vada pavs, dosas, idlis, eggs. There was a crowd around each stall. Appetising aromas wafted from their woks and pans. I wondered at the ease and skill with which the dosas were tossed, the eggs flipped and the sandwiches made by the dozen with admirable efficiency and without wasting a minute or missing a customer! I smiled to myself. I thought of the time management and developmental programs I conducted in the corporate space and thought to myself. Here are our self taught achievers taught by life itself!

Another old melody wafted towards me. Wistful, forlorn, a song of parting, pain and separation from some old movie again. I suddenly saw him. A small thin young man with a little pot belly, and a wooden bamboo pole in his arms. And like a tree with bare branches, hand carved flutes of all sizes and shapes hung off it. He had a flute in his hands. He had just finished the song. He eyes were deep pools of anguish. It troubled me. What I wondered was the sorrow of his life that seeped from his soul and poured through his empty flute?

He caught me looking at his bunch of flutes. He looked at me and asked earnestly, “ Madam, would you buy a flute from me? I desperately need the money. I have sold just one flute and made 70 Rupees today. What can I take back for my wife and young daughter?” He asked me.

“ You play the flute so well! What is your name? I asked him.

“Imran”, he replied.

He started chatting. “I am from Uttar Pradesh. A small village that you may never have heard of” he added. He sat down on the stone nearby wearily.

“He suddenly looked up and said, I have eaten nothing since morning”. I noticed that he was chewing tobacco. I asked him gently “ Will this tobacco not harm you specially on an empty stomach?” He smiled. “Yes, but I have to be able to bear the pangs of hunger” he said, matter of factly.

I felt a pang of deep sadness.

I asked him, “ May I buy you a meal?” And handed over some money to him. He looked at it for a while, then folded it and put it into his pocket. I asked him, “ will you not eat?”

He looked at me and said, “Madam, I will buy some food and take it home. My little daughter can share it too along with my wife. “

“But you will reach home late in the evening Imran. Will you stay hungry until then?”.

He said nothing and looked down at the ground.

He pulled out a wrinkled picture from his pocket and showed me his daughter’s photograph. A child of about four years of age. She was on the bed with a bandages on both her leg. “What happened to her?” I asked him with concern.

We live in a remote hillside hutment colony he said listlessly, looking down into the blazing asphalt. There stood before me a broken man, who could not see the way out of the maze.

“ The hills are treacherous,” he said. “The children of the slum go out to play on the dangerous hillside. A huge stone rolled down and crashed into my daughter’s feet during the heavy rains. She, my four year old princess is now bed ridden unless treatment can be provided”. I could not help wondering if this was a story to create sympathy I glanced again at the picture of his young child, and was rather ashamed. There she was, a bright eyed, smiling little child in bandaged legs, propped on the bed.

He carried on and his eyes filled up. “ We lost our second baby last week. My wife was in the last stages of pregnancy. She was so weak that she lost the baby and is now in bed.” He looked up and raised his hands. She is up there now, my baby, gone before she even opened her eyes.” I thought of his young wife, whose life was probably snatched from her as she herself was not more than a child.

I conjured the young couple, having no more tears to shed, broken by their fate and circumstances, and putting away their loss into a little deep recess in their hearts so they could look after their injured older child.

He told me that a few sympathetic families have helped him but he still fell short of the total amount for the treatment of his elder daughter.

I knew nothing about him except his plaintive heart-wrenching melodies. On impulse I asked him to follow me and disappeared into the nearest ATM. I withdrew whatever money I had there and handed it over to him. He was overwhelmed but his need was so huge that he kept asking me to help him with more. “I promise to work and pay back every Rupee madam.” He said, with a catch in his voice. He then asked me if I would mind collecting some clothes for his child and wife. I made a mental note to do this from my networks.

I waved to him and walked away. He called out, “ The almighty will bless you abundantly for helping a stranger”. I wondered if the almighty would bless him too. I really hoped so.

“ Madam”, he called out again. I turned around. He ran to me with a flute and said, “This is a gift for you”. I was horrified to take away something that he could sell and told him so. I also told him I could not play the flute. He smiled for the first time and answered, “ I will teach you some day! Keep this as a thank you gift from my daughter”. I felt the smooth lines of the flute slip into my hands. I held it tight and I walked back home.

As I left, he played a lilting tune that sounded as if the hollow flute had filled up with something enchanting . It was a feeling, an intangible little energy, something I could not lay my finger on. A momentary balm on his crushed spirit? Was it a wisp of hope, a glimpse of the road ahead?

I hoped his little daughter would walk again. I hoped they would see her hopping around their hillside hut. I wished life was kinder and he would have a home someday. I wished his wife would dress up in pretty clothes and he would smile into her eyes . I wanted them to find a reason to rejoice at least once in their harsh life. Most of all I wished him the courage and the resilience to go on. I wished he could find the strength grasp that elusive ray of hope and step into the road ahead , though it is not easy to hope on an empty stomach.

I got into the elevator and reached home. As I sat down at the window and looked out into the garden where I knew he stood with his pole of bamboo flutes, I saw Imran pick up his flute. He played a melody that was not sad. It beckoned hope I felt.

I watched him, for that moment completely lost in his melody. I heard him, mesmerised yet again.

Imran, I wish you well. You whose name alas ironically stands for happiness and prosperity. I wish you peace in the days ahead. I silently wished him what he wished me, “May the Almighty fill your life with abundance.”
