She works with fragrances.

Dia has the exact blend of perfume for every soul. As an aroma therapist, she has been around the world and has learnt all the secrets of essential oils. They talk to her like lost souls to an enchantress.

At Gulmohar Avenue, a set of twenty row houses, ten on either side of the broad pathway that separates them within the gated community, seem to be in deep slumber. The security port is lit with a bright yellow bulb and the path between the houses is lit with yellow streetlights, five on either side. The beam of light that illuminated the pathway looks mysterious like a piece of absurd literature in that still hour at four in the morning.

Dia stays in the fourth house from the right of the entrance- L-04.

Her bedroom is set in the bohemian style. It has an L-shaped seating arrangement at one end, which is made of thick material with orange and violet as dominating colours in the otherwise rainbow hued fabric. The other end of the room has a round bed with a lavender satin bed-sheet.

Dia, is fast asleep; her head sunk into the pillow, her silken hair floats like a stream glowing in the moonlight. The cool early morning breeze that comes through the open window is calming.

Suddenly, she is awakened by a shrill of music. The tune that reaches Dia’s ears was familiar. In the voice of M S Subbulakshmi it is the song, “Bhavayami Gopalabalam….” The otherwise heavenly voice sounded cacophonous to her at this hour. Disgruntled, she sits up on the bed frowning and removes the pink silk eye mask from her sleepy eyes. She puts it up on her head as a band that holds the soft hair back-hair that usually cascades down to her glowing golden- hued cheeks.

Looking at the open window adjacent to her bed, she sees that the house next door is all lit up. It had a festive atmosphere. Peeping through the window, she notices an old lady bending to clean the front yard. She must be in her late sixties or early seventies. The song comes from an old tape recorder that rests on an armchair in the verandah of the house.

Dia, can now hear one more sound as an accompaniment to the song that was being played- trash of the broom. She looks at all the activity helplessly and then tries to go back to sleep.

At this moment, she hears the whistling sound of the milk-cooker and the pressure cooker that sang like two well-matched singers in *jugalbandi*.1 

Feeling absolutely defeated and fidgeting for a while on the bed, she gets hold of the cell phone on the side table and reads the time as five o' clock. She grabs the book beside it and while playing with her neatly french-manicured fingers, she reads out aloud the first appointment of the day, “Shripriya Srinath at ten”

She goes into the kitchen to make herself a cup of ginger tea. Slowly sipping her tea in the front-yard she sees the old lady happily seated in the armchair slurping her coffee from a huge steel tumbler.

Sitting on the first step near the entrance door, she shuts her eyes while holding her tea cup. She is shaken by the loud chanting of Vishnu Sahasranaama2. The old lady next door is totally immersed in chanting the verses from a small turmeric-smeared dog-eared book that looks ancient. Dia finishes her tea quickly and goes into the house, has a shower and is ready for the day.

She entres her office, which is right across her bedroom. It is a small room with a huge wall length mirror and a rectangular table attached to it. There are small empty glass bottles of different sizes on it, neatly arranged on jute trays, and at the other end, is a sofa and two single chairs. There is a cabinet in teak wood filled with bottles of essential aroma oils at one corner of the room. The bottles bear neat labels in cursive handwriting: reading rose, patchouli, lavender, sandalwood, cinnamon, sage, frankincense, rosemary, lemon, orange blossom, cherry and the like.

She sits there for a while and blends a few oils and labels them with names of her clients, Vatsala and Lilly Andrews.

She has fruits for breakfast and then the domestic help comes in.

In a frustrated tone Dia asks her “Kamala, who is that lady next door? We know that for one whole year no one lived there. Who is she and from where has she appeared all of a sudden?”

Lost in her own thoughts while mopping the house, Kamala says “No idea Memsahib. Will ask Renu, she is a gossip monger”

Dia, terribly displeased with Kamala’s lack of knowledge about the neighbourhood nods her head in exasperation and asks her to prepare some coffee for her while she reads the newspaper with her glasses on.

Dia is thirty-eight years old. She has a fair complexion, a sharp nose and large eyes. Her hair flowed freely down to her waist. She wears a black wrap-around plain skirt and a floral yellow cotton top.

It is 9 am. She is eagerly waiting for her client who is expected after an hour. Kamala is preparing lunch.

The house next door seemed perpetually noisy with different sounds of the blender, mortar and pestle and many more indistinct noises. The sounds seem inevitable to and she knows very well that she cannot shift her bedroom, as the two bedrooms in Dia’s house, faced the kitchen and one bedroom of the old lady’s house and the third bedroom is Dia’s office.

There’s a knock at the door and Kamala announces the arrival of Shripriya.

Both of them go into the office and Shripriya says with a pleasant smile “The oil blend helped my freckles a lot. I would like some more of it.”

With her zooming glass, as she examines Shripriya’s skin, Dia exclaims “I am happy with the result. Your skin looks much better. This time I will make a less concentrated blend for you in a lotion base. The oil will remain the same, rose-hip. Will blend a little more of hemp to help with the open pores”

She smiles at her client who is very pleased at the prescription. She goes to the table near the mirror and gets two empty glass bottles and makes the blend in a tray, labels them, and hands them to Shripriya in a small beige cloth bag, which bears the words in golden print- 'scent for the soul' with her signature as Dia Sharma in embroidered golden letters.

Shripriya is about to leave when she suddenly scrutinizes Dia's face and says,

" You don’t look your normal self today, Is everything alright?"

“Yes…all well. Just that I could not sleep too well, hence feel a little tired”

She smiles at her client who is convinced and leaves her. She scans her diary-back-to-back appointments for the day, with the last one at nine that night. A break at two for lunch and tea at five, and on-line aroma therapy sessions in between- it is an exhausting day for her.

At night after ten she has her dinner - fried rice and some salad. Then she works on her aroma therapy book and later takes a hot shower infused with lavender for insomnia. She goes to sleep around midnight with some lavender oil on her wrists. A few dried lavender flowers sprinkled with aroma oil are tucked under the pillow.

This time there is a sharp sweeping sound of the broom at three in the morning, and the song changed to another Krishna kirtan.

Dia tries closing the windows in vain. The sounds still reach her ears. The whistles of the cookers are now familiar. The whole thing spools like a plot that never changes. The old lady is shouting at the milkman for getting the milk at five, which to her is rather late.

The next day Kamala has news about the lady. In great excitement she tells her that the old lady’s son, who stays abroad, had purchased the house recently and she’s come to live here permanently.

Almost a month passes with the same schedule and Dia’s sleep deprivation continues but she can do nothing about this. This time she goes to the secretary of the avenue, Mr. Dharma Achary.

She explains her problem to him, “Sir, please help me. There is this old lady in L -03, who gets up early morning and wakes me up with all kinds of noises, please tell her that she cannot disturb the neighbours like that. I am a working woman and have loads of work throughout the day. I need my five hours of sleep. It's been three weeks since I had a decent amount of sleep."

Mr Dharma Achary listens to the story very patiently and responds in an affectionate tone,

“Dia, I understand what you are saying, but Radha Ramani is like that. Her son shared with me. And as she is at her place we cannot ask her to alter her routine for us. Try closing the window or shift into the third bedroom. Yes?”

She could sense that he was very empathetic towards the old lady and nurtured a strong affection for her, perhaps because both of them were close in age.

She comes back home disappointed and tired, and decides to talk to Radha Ramani directly.

At 9 o 'clock the next morning she goes to Radha Ramani’s house. She finds the gate locked and after several attempts to ring the bell, only to realize later that the bell doesn't work. Radha Ramani comes out slowly and opens the gate. Dia introduces herself “Auntyji, I am Dia Sharma. I live next door”

The old lady smiles and pats Dia on her shoulder “You are so beautiful I keep looking at you sipping tea. Wait I’ll get some coffee. My daughter looks just like you. She is in New Jersey…look at her picture there on the wall with her family. I will get coffee”

Dia examines all the pictures on the wall in the living area.

In the kitchen Radha prepares coffee. The milk cooker whistles merrily. Dia smiles at that familiar sound.

Radha looks at Dia and says “Did you lock your gate?”

“No, Kamala is there. I am an aroma therapist Aunty ji. I work with oils”

"Ah …like ayurvedic doctor, you work with *tailas3*? Now I know why I often smell those oils…cinnamon, orange and several flowers from your house, so nice!”

Dia examined Radha Ramani’s face- flawless skin and affectionate eyes.

Radha suddenly asks Dia “Can you make some oil for my feet? They ache a lot. Raja, my son, can pay you online. Back in the village, the ayurvedic vaidya4 used to make one for me. Raja, sold our house in the village and got me here. I know no one here. Where are your parents?"

“They’re no more. I got married three years back, now I am seeking divorce. My lawyer is working on it”

Radha exclaims with concern “Ah but why?”

“Auntyji… several issues that cannot be ignored. Guess we cannot just get along with each other, so it’s better we part ways. We were here together till last year. This year he shifted to another place nearby and I am here. This house is mine. I pay the EMI”

Radha looked shocked.

Dia thanks her for the coffee, promises to make the oil, and gets back home.

The moment she enters her house, Kamala comes with a glass of water and in a happy tone asks her “Memsahib all set?”

A bit disoriented, Dia asks her “Did anyone call? Kamala shakes her head to indicate that no one had called. As usual the day begins at eleven with clients.

It is eight thirty and the last client doesn't turn up so Dia takes the opportunity to make the oil for Radha Ramani. She blends eucalyptus oil in coconut and camphor and other oils and takes it to her.

This time Radha says" Dia, have dinner with me…I am making idli and coconut chutney” Dia happily accepts the invitation.

While Radha is busy preparing the chutney and idlis, Dia enters the kitchen and looks at her bedroom from the kitchen. There is only a thin wall separating them.

She smiles at herself and asks Radha, “Aunty ji, how do you manage to stay alone?”

With the coconut shredder in her hand, Radha says “My husband was a very disciplined person. He rose at four every morning, two idlis and coffee for breakfast at seven, elaborate lunch at eleven, coffee and snacks at three, two chapattis and curry at seven for dinner, some milk at eight. At half past eight, he would go to sleep, listening to the radio. His strict schedule could not give me time to rest, but I got used to it and never complained.”

She looked at the old man’s neatly framed picture in the kitchen. It had a garland that she herself wove with flowers from her front yard.

She continues “After his death last year and with the children being abroad, initially it was difficult for me to stay alone, but life is all about moving on and adjusting to new things and people. Here I am in the city, far away from my hometown Vijayanagaram….no relatives or friends…but I keep his schedule intact. My daughter chides me ‘Amma why do you get up so early? Get some rest. Appa is not there anymore' They don’t understand all this”

Dia gives her a warm smile. They have dinner together and then she gives the eucalyptus oil -a gift.

Radha is pleased by the gesture" Ah, the oil smell is similar to what my vaidya4, Sham Rao used to give me. You must be a great doctor!"

Dia shows her the process of a simple foot massage and makes her practice the steps.

One morning, Dia gets up at seven and suddenly realizes that Radha’s house is quiet. She jumps out of the bed. The front yard is filled with leaves left un-swept. She goes to the gate. It is locked. She first thinks of jumping over the gate, but instead she calls the security guard who comes immediately. They break open the lock and enter the house with the spare keys.

Running into the bedroom Dia calls out “Auntyji…Auntyji…” and is shocked to see Radha in pain. She can barely move her body and is sweating profusely. Calling for an ambulance, Dia takes Radha to the nearest hospital. The doctor confirms it as a mild heart stroke…. Dharma Achary who comes later, gets in touch with Radha’s son. He reaches the hospital within two days. Dia takes care of Radha till he arrives.

After ten days Radha recovers well and comes home.

Her son Raja comes to Dia’s place and thanks her warmly for all the help.

“I am taking Amma with me to my place as I feel that it is not safe to let her be alone in her present state. The doctor says that it may recur. The tickets are booked and we shall be leaving in four days’ time”

On the day Radha and her son are leaving, Dia makes some more eucalyptus oil for Radha and gives it to her “This is for you. Do not forget foot massage procedure that I taught you”

Radha gives a set of keys to Dia, and embraces her “Do not forget to water my plants every day”

The next morning, Dia wakes up at four and looks at the house from the open window.

*She strained to hear something, anything,but there was only silence.*

Total silence. “Is this peaceful?” She wonders.

The light fragrance of eucalyptus fills the empty spaces of her mind.
