I wander through the wilderness

Unknowing, not caring

Whither I go,

Restless, searching

Filled with despair

Haunted by those

Beguiling eyes

That I saw

In that passing caravan

Two days ago.

Was it just a mirage

Like one sees

Of the lone palm tree

Way, way ahead

Beyond the dunes?

Or is it an oasis

Waiting in some hidden spot.

For they passed

In front of me

Of that, I am sure.

Smitten by those

Beguiling eyes

That seemed to smile

At me through the purdah,

I stood rooted

To the spot

Unable to move

Incapable of action

And suddenly 'poof'

They are gone

I know not where

In this vast

Desert bare.

I have no water

No food to eat

My throat is parched

Sores on my feet

Go down on my knees

Drag myself forward

Till I can breathe

No more.

I lie face upwards

Scorched by the sun

Ready to die.

A cool trickle of water

Hits my face.

There she stands

Water spout in hand

Smiling her dazzling smile

She with the beguiling eyes!
