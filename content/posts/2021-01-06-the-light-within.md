Hope let out green tendrils from its burrow

As fearful eyes looked up from their virus induced sorrow

The festival of lights decked in her fairy like finery

Was descending from her tower of ivory

Bearing in her arms a wicker basket of joy

Promising she will evil and darkness destroy

Homes glowed with lamps that spread their lights bright

Weaving golden magic webs into the night

The little girls wore flowers in their hair

The ladies decked themselves in festive wear

The menfolk in their traditional attire

Spoke fondly of erstwhile tales over a beer

The magic lasted through the night

Folks put aside many a petty fight

Then went back to the lonely home

A little breath caught in the gloam

The magic that hope brought was fading

The twinkling lamps were disappearing

A million lamps that glowed with pride

But none could light up the fragile mind

That lamp none else can light but me

How I wished the darkness would flee

A flicker flashed across my eye

And there I spied the light within me!
