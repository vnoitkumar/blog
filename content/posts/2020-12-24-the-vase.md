dishevelled pages breaking free


from tattered notebooks


letters unsent, life poorly spent


like the vase that stood, watched


 the test of time, empty, and eternally dusty



like a vase without flower


like a life without love


nay a mind as unkempt


indeed, an existence so hollow


zilch, dragged in vortex of miseries

will a twig change the facade?


or should i fetch a bunch of orchids


just another moment of passion


or a sea of unbridled ecstasy


my stories seek to unravel



and yet when the gust strikes


the flame deserts the torch


the passion meekly abates


the vase loses its balance


Ah! one heart, yet many fragments!
