**WE’LL HUG AGAIN YET!**

The two little finches a-snuggle

Assure me that life’s worth the struggle;

Say not that in vain was our valour,

***Results*** come in many a colour.

When the virus we fight's done and won,

Oh! With the next rising sun,

We'll soar yet again like the eagle

And dare yet to hug, ... and to snuggle.

(Inspired by Arthur Hugh Clough's *'Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth*')

**ON A CARPET OF WHITE DAISIES IN THE DAWN**

This scene took me over to ol’ Langston Hughes,

And the poem he wrote called "Dreams";

Awed (ever, it seems) with the depth of his views,

I’ve become a dreamer of dreams.

I dreamt then of dreams that’ve kept me a-going,

(Dementia they do keep at bay!)

And flowers delightful are always a-growing

In my dreams, on a cold winter's day.

In dreams I can steadily, happily gaze

At the wonders of Nature benign,

In spite of the snow and the dark wintry haze:

When dreams do with mem’ries combine.

When dreams and my mem’ries in a cauldron are brewed,

There’s beauty, and tears, and rapture

And the pledge of a space where none can intrude,

That few can, in words, really capture.

Although the whole earth is covered today

With gloom and suspicions galore

We dream of the vaccine that’s coming our way

With hope … of life … and of more.
