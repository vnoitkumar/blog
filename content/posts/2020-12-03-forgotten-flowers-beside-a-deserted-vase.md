the hands that plucked these flowers

did not reach the vase

the words that rose in her heart

never reached the ears they were meant for.

the heart that welled up with dreams

froze in a moment in time

to fade into forgotten phantoms.

the highwayman’s promise to his beloved

“yet if they press me sharply

and harry me through the day

then look for me by moonlight

watch for me by moonlight

i’ll come to thee by moonlight

though hell should bar the way”

broke into fragments of scattered words

“as they shot him down on the highway

down like a dog on the highway

and he lay in his blood on the highway

with a bunch of lace at his chin.”

and thus they found his lover

the one with the flowing hair

like a crumpled doll by the window

flowers deserted

vase deserted

just one single bloom in her hand

now withering like her body

now withered like her soul.
