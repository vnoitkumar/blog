 **I**

*Can you try delaying the tide?*

*Moe, says he, did walk inside*

*A sea that’s split in two.*

*And then… **He** woke up to*

*A stormy sea, a raging tide.*

*At **His** command the storm went down*

*The laws of physics made to drown.*

*The sea ne’er stood a chance*

*When e’en the Sun did dance*

*To his tune, till the dreaded foe was down.*

**II**

*When Canute tried to stop the sea,*

*It drenched his royal majesty*

*Nonchalantly as it rolled*

*O’er shoes of braided gold*

*And said: Dear king, ne’er trifle with me!*

*You’ll never know my inner strengths*

*Nor ever gauge the awesome lengths*

*I’ve gone to get explorers*

*Pirates and conquistadors*

*Who lie now at my various depths.*

*For those who watch me from the shore*

*I am a ver’table mystery, sure.*

*But those of you who dare,*

*And your peaceful life forswear,* 

*Are part of human history… and more.*

*Oh, many a poet have I inspired;*

*And those who dared, I’ve fully fired:*

*See Magellan, Cook, Amerigo*

*Or Tennyson, Woolfe or Allan Poe*

*Their efforts are the stuff that’s still admired .*

### `III`

*And yet **you** try to capture me*

*In paintings and photography!?*

*Reduce me to the plight*

*Of a bright-eyed artist’s delight?*

*You wait until the next tsunami!*

[NOTES:

The first line hides the name of Canute, the king of Denmark, who tried to command the waves to stop

The second line hides the name of Moses, who, according to the Bible, had split the Red Sea to allow free passage for the Jews fleeing from the Pharoah’s troops.

***He*** could refer to Jesus Christ or Krishna – as both are mentioned in tales involving calming of raging waters.

The “dance” of the sun is seen in the Mahabharata (Arjun’s pursuit of Jayadratha) and in the biblical narration of the conquest of the Amorites (Joshua 10:12-15).]
