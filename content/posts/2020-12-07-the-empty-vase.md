**The vase lamented its hollow emptiness** 


**As a heart bemoans its brokenness** 


**The wilting chrysanthemums carelessly strewn**


**Were now just memories of an erstwhile bloom** 


Where are those days of boundless love 


That saw flowers of iridescent hue 


Brought home by the lover for the beloved


And was in my embrace enveloped 





The love has ebbed like a low tide sea


The warmth and laughter were now not to be


Love’s embers caused a painful emptiness 


That gazed at the raw scars of loneliness

I have witnessed radiant love blossom


And sadly seen it become just flotsam


Memories of joyous togetherness 


A home of sunshine and tenderness


All dashed into empty nothingness 

**The vase grieved its own emptiness** 


**As it lamented love’s brokenness**
