**Apeirogon**- a shape with a countably infinite number of sides.\
\
Having decided on the title Apeirogon the author decided to throw the story at us in an infinite number of countable pieces, some meeting at some vague point and some floating around with an apparent purposelessness. Lots of interesting titbits on multivarious topics thrown in for good measure. Even Chapter numbers moved backward and forward in keeping with the general pattern. Perhaps he did all this because his story content could be fitted into a few pages but had been paid by his publisher to create a solid tome!?! Most of the time I felt like my son-in-law\
Sumanth's golden retriever, waiting for one morsel of food after the other to be thrown to me. Some interesting, some really tasty and some so-so. But I couldn't let go of the book either.\

That being said, the story of Bassam and Rami hits hard. It's not just the story of the grief of losing one's child. Something that one just cannot get over ever. The seven years that Bassam spends in jail is heart rending. So much has been said about the holocaust. The Jews deserved their own country. And yes, they deserved to defend it with all their might. But to the Palestinians they were marauders who were taking over their land. Something like the descendants of the Chozhan king suddenly claiming that Thanjavur is his territory. That was then. Now it is a part of India. Being victims of the holocaust one would expect the Israelis to be more humane. But no, they gradually turned into terrible oppressors themselves. Then retaliation. And so the story goes on in every part of the world. Which leaves you feeling that the baser instincts in the human being far surpass the milk of human kindness that we yearn for continually. The saddest part of all is that in this viscious game, it is the poor youth, the seventeen to twenty year olds who end up committing all the heinous atrocities, all the gunning down, the beating up, the suicide bombing. What a horrendous way of entering manhood - hardened, bitter and cynical. Like when Bassam tells the young soldier who shot his daughter after the trial - You are the victim. Not me. Thank god for people like Bassam and Rami who fiercely fight for non violence and peace, I thought. But was shocked at what they envisaged for that eighteen year old who shot the rubber bullet at Bassam's daughter. Deep in their hearts they wanted revenge. So what are we as a human race?? The whole group felt that to feel a momentary anger at the perpetrator of Abir's death is very normal and what needs to be appreciated is that both Bassam and Rami will never deviate from the path of non violence.\
\
One conversation that stays in my head is the one about the 4 hundred thousand compensation. Someone tells Bassam casually that finally he was lucky. He was given a good compensation. Bassam tells him," I'll give you the money. Give me your son to have killed." The man tries to excuse himself by saying that it was a terrible act by the government. Bassam replies,"I'll give my 400k plus another 400k plus one more over that. Give me your son for my government to kill." The man ended up hanging his head in shame. It is easy to be judgemental over something that happens to someone else.\

On the whole it was heavy reading but well worth it.
