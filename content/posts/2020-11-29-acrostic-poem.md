What is an Acrostic?

Acrostics are a fun poetic form that anyone can write. They have just a few simple rules, and this lesson will teach you how to create acrostic poems of your own.

To begin with, an acrostic is a poem in which the first letters of each line spell out a word or phrase. The word or phrase can be a name, a thing, or whatever you like. When children write acrostics, they will often use their own first name, or sometimes the first name of a friend.

Usually, the first letter of each line is capitalized. This makes it easier to see the word spelled out vertically down the page.

Acrostics are easy to write because they don’t need to rhyme, and you don’t need to worry about the rhythm of the lines. Each line can be as long or as short as you want it to be.

Creating an Acrostic in Five Easy Steps

To create an acrostic, follow these five easy steps:

1. Decide what to write about.
2. Write your word down *vertically*.
3. Brainstorm words or phrases that describe your idea.
4. Place your brainstormed words or phrases on the lines that begin with the same letters.
5. Fill in the rest of the lines to create a poem.

WRITER’S ARK ,as an Acrostic by ***Malini Nair***

**W**ords! They capture the essence of our thoughts

**R**eaching out with tales that the soul has wrought

**I**nspired by contemplation of life’s experience

**T**umultuous in their melancholy, until they find coherence

**E**merging at times though, with a pinch of humour

**R**eleasing the mind from its weary stupor

**S**tories of resilience, tales of love, writings so diverse

**A**s magic is woven with stories and verse

**R**egaling, educating and elevating the mind

**K**inship in this haven of narratives we always find
