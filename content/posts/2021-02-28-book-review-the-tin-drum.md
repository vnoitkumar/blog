This is a book about the inter-war period in Danzig[](#_ftn1) Poland. Let’s get the story off our chest first – or at least a part that would draw you into reading this review!

Oskar Matzerath, son of Agnes and her husband, Alfred Matzerath – (or, was it Agnes and her cousin-lover Jan Bronsky?) – admits to writing his memoirs from a mental asylum. His mother promises him a tin drum on his third birthday, on which fateful day, Oskar decides not to grow up into an adult. Oskar also has a “gift” of sorts: he can shatter any glass with his singing/screaming, which he uses as a revenge or a threat and, (at least once) to create art. For a three-year-old he has remarkable intelligence and capacity of observation.

The story is as odd as its beginning: his grandmother a criminal under her skirts, as he was being chased by the police, and she conceives (or, according to Oskar, it may have been later, in the cart or …!) The criminal, an arsonist, marries the accommodating young lady but he is soon at the wrong end of a police chase: it is not clear whether he died there or escaped to the US, where he prospered as a firefighter, among other things. The rest of the novel meanders and rambles into several seemingly insignificant events. In fact, it takes quite a level of determination to continue reading the stuff running to almost 580 pages. It did, however, get the author the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999.

Many reviewers have extolled the book as they see the reflection of the world situation and, particularly, of Poland, in the 1920-40s in the life of the three-year-old who ends up in a mental asylum. Reviewers have also said that Grass depicts the evolution of the 20th century – as it moved from “agricultural to industrial, traditional to cosmopolitan, feudal to post-modern”. Oskar, however, was taken up more with the smell of his grandmother “like rancid butter” and that of his step-mother … whose son, he claims as his own.

The book was condemned as obscene: there are several occasions when Oskar is witness to scenes that should have been taboo for his age. He has a sexual relationship with his teenage step-mother, too. The “correctness” of such scenes, particularly in the movie (1979: directed by Volker Schlöndorff) with 11-year-old David Bennent, is another matter. It did win the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 1979 and several other prizes.

The only time, in the entire story, where the drum is seen to have some significance is at a party rally, where Oskar, sitting under the stadium, drums out his own beat, competing with the fascist marching band, transforming the stiff Nazi rigour into a lively waltz – the military band coverts it to the strains of The Blue Danube (Johann Strauss). At the end of the novel, he claims to have murdered a nurse, and is found guilty … the reason why he is in the asylum in the first place.

The expression: “to beat a drum” means to publicize something or to actively support something. Beating a tin drum has not direct meaning, as an idiom, except a derived connotation of creating a disturbance. Reviewers have held that Oskar beats the tin drum to bring attention to a cause. It is said to symbolize “his protest against the middle-class mentality of his family and neighborhood," and through that, to draw attention to the horrors that the “grown-ups” indulge in. But he does not hesitate to expose Jan Bronsky to sure death when the Germans came in; he does not hesitate to expose Alfred Matzerath as a Nazi when the Russians came in. No tin drum was heard at that time. Grass brings up several scenes where Jewish and Roman Catholic beliefs and practices are ridiculed – perhaps a mentally unstable protagonist was appropriate, and would not invite criticism to himself personally.

And then comes the shocker: Günter Grass, champion against the “war crimes” in Vietnam, and racism in America, the German conscience-keeper, reveals at the age of 78 (see Washington Times: Sunday, August 20, 2006: *“The Hypocrite’s Halo”*), after having beaten the tin drum until all the war criminals were brought to book, that he was a Nazi himself, “a soldier of the Waffen SS, *the special unit that made the Holocaust work*”. It has also been suggested that he made his confession shortly before the publication of his autobiography.[](<>)

This is one book I would not recommend.

Danzig, a port-city on the Baltic, has always been the subject of struggle between Germany and Poland. After WW-I it was decided to set up The Free City of Danzig which neither Germany nor Poland would control but would exist independently – with Poland enjoying certain privileges. But, by 1936, it’s senate had a majority of local Nazis, which led to strong pressures to re-join Germany. Many Jews fled. By 1939, Polish-German relations had worsened and war seemed a likely possibility. After their invasion into Poland, the Nazis abolished the “Free City” while classifying Poles and Jews as sub-human – to be discriminated against, forced into labour…and extermination. In 1945, it came back to Poland severely underpopulated for various reasons.
