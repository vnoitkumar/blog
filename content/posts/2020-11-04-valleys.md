valleys, before me\
lying open\
like a woman\
giving\
receiving\
unfolding towards distant skies\
with a certain charm of elemental

vulgarity.

i walk forward with the same confident\
lust\
as of the suckling’s eager hands\
on his mother's breast\
and it is mine\
all of it –

each rise, and fall,\
each mound and groove\
each crevice\
each erect contour, rising\
like taut nipples,\
all mine.

\
i am overpowered by this sense of possession\
as i sit here and write\
but soon i see this shepherd walking by\
staff in his arm and his flock before him\
grazing\
on her flesh\
and i know the valleys can never be mine\
for\
i am just the passing lover

and he, the eternal

child.
