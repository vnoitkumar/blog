Suddenly have all of them turned sober and sedate;

They send their morning wishes without images, of late!

“What a trap this WhatsApp has turned out to be!” they say

There’s said to be a phish in what they’d sent to us each day.

But now I’m sorely missing all those flowers and those birds

With colours so diverse, so bright, all used instead of words

They’d like to have a choice of words, these heralds of the dawn.

But how m’ny ways for them are there to tell you that it’s morn!

Those pictures in their “thousand words”, did greet in myriad ways,

Telling you it’s a brand, new day – in no uncertain ways!

But then you can’t be sure about WhatsAppening these days!

They’ll hack into your cell, they say, and leave in you in a daze!

And just when they all thought that sending pictures was just fine

And happily, so many did to *forwarding* incline.

Sent they those greetings every morn, no reason nor a rhyme,

For proper words no struggled search, for loving thoughts no grime.

I marvel how those images had all emotions smothered.

In our own words, to speak our hearts, no one was really bothered.

But, now they come with touching words, their wishes freely flowing;

The morning, once again, feels good, as if a cock was crowing!
