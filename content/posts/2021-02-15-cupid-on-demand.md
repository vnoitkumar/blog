*It's the loveliest love story I've ever heard and I love to recount it whenever I get a chance. It was told to me by my father-in-law's cousin when we visited him once in Bangalore a few years after we got married. Perhaps I'll tell you the story the way he told it to me.*

It was during the Second World War. Burma was about to turn into another war zone. Your father-in-law's family was in Rangoon at that time and I also lived and worked with them. Grandpa, his son and son-in-law ran a large Accountants' practice. They decided that Grandpa, and all the women and children would leave for India on the very next ship and that the younger men would hold fort in Rangoon. Both of them with Ananth to their names, your father-in- law - Anantharaman was known as Raman while his brother-in-law Ananthanarayanan was referred to as Ananthan.

Raman and his wife Meenakshi had lost their first child, a daughter, to pneumonia and now had a four year old daughter. Before they parted, Raman and Meenakshi exchanged rings. While Meenakshi could comfortably wear his ring on her middle finger, Raman could not achieve a perfect fit on any finger. "Why didn't he wrap some thread around it," one of you prudent women may say, but that was the last thing on his mind. He was distraught at the thought of parting from his beloved wife. The early years of their marriage had been fraught with problems but that's another story. I'll come to that later.

Soon, as you all know, there was an exodus from Burma with civilians leaving in droves to escape with their lives. Those who had to return to India had to walk to Mandalay from Rangoon and then work their way through forests and hilly terrain to Imphal in India. There was fear of dacoity on the way and of wild animals in the forests. So, a large group of us got together, loaded essential personal belongings and enough provisions, cooking vessels, and other things on to bullock carts and travelled in a caravan on the assumption that there is strength in large numbers in case of attack. Every day, we walked till evening time and stopped for the night close to a stream or on the outskirts of a village. Early in the morning we cooked, had breakfast, packed lunch and continued on our journey. There were many people from all walks of life from all parts of India who made that trek at that time.

One day, we had been walking for about two hours when Raman suddenly realised that his ring was missing. "I have to go back," he said. He said that it must have fallen into the stream while he was washing early in the morning before dawn. He said that he was sure that he would find it there. Everyone thought he was mad. Surely he could buy his wife another ring? Did he realise how long it would take to go back? It would upset the whole of that day's programme. Added to everything, we were entering dacoit territory. It was not safe to turn back, they all said firmly. But Raman was adamant. He said that he would go back alone. They could proceed and he would catch up with them at the planned site of halt either that night or the next day. I offered to go with him. So we turned back and the rest carried on.

People stopped and stared at us all the time. What were we doing walking in the wrong direction? Some warned us that it was not safe to go back. Some even stopped us to ask what was wrong and if they could be of any help.

"Sorry da," Raman said, "You needn't have come. It's not safe."

"Then why are you going," I asked.

"It is Meenakshi's wedding ring," he replied looking forlorn. "We exchanged rings as a reminder of our devotion to each other. How did I go and lose it? I cannot go back without it."

"Dey," I said, "Its ten years since you both got married and you still have such a deep love for your wife, my cousin Meenakshi. It is a lesson for all of us da. And anyway am I not Cupid?"

*CUPID, I ASKED, FLABBERGASTED.*

*"YES, YES, I'M COMING TO THAT," UNCLE SAID LAUGHING AT MY EXPRESSION. PLEASED WITH HIMSELF, ACTUALLY.*

Remember I told you that they had problems in their early years of marriage? Grandpa, Meenakshi's father, after getting her married to a sterling young man and bringing him across to Burma to do his studies to become a Chartered Accountant, ordained that their marriage will not be consummated until his daughter became a Graduate. Imagine the agony. Living under the same roof, married and not allowed to be together? I would be a go- between for them to exchange letters. Raman bought a beautiful brooch. It was a small bird with a chain in its beak from which dangled a heart. I delivered it to Meenakshi in her College. Then I did something for which I was in Grandpa's bad books for a very long time. Once, during her study leave when Meenakshi was alone at home for a longish period of time, I helped Raman to sneak into the house and stood guard at the front door while they spent a few hours together and consummated their marriage in the process.

OMG! I EXCLAIMED. HOW DID THEY GET TO KNOW?

HOW? SHE BECAME PREGNANT, THAT'S HOW, HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER. FORTUNATELY SHE GRADUATED BEFORE SHE DELIVERED SO I WAS SAVED!

Anyway, coming back to the original story, we finally arrived at the stream where we had camped the previous night. He pointed out to the stone on which he had sat, went there, warned me not to put my foot into the water and disturb it and looked carefully. The water was crystal clear, the sun was shining brightly, and the water rippled as it flowed. Suddenly there was a flash of light. Raman stepped in softly, put his hand in and brought up a small fistful of sand. Opening his hand very slowly, he moved the sand gently with one finger and what winked at him? Yes! The ring! We were overjoyed.

Quickly we set out to return to our group before dark. It was night by the time we reached the village where we were to stop that night. There was no caravan and to our utter despair there was no village at all. Apparently the dacoits had struck that day, pillaged the village and burnt it down to boot. The villagers had fled and were most probably taking refuge in the forest for the night. But where did our caravan go? We had no way of finding out. So we spent that night clinging on to each other, crouching behind the burnt down wall of a hut, shivering and terrified for our lives.

The next morning at sunrise, we decided to just follow the route that we had originally set for ourselves and pray for the best. Tired, hungry, worried and scared, late that evening we saw a caravan threading its way in the distance. We let out a huge whoop of relief and speeded up with new vigour. What did it matter whose caravan it was? We'd definitely get food and protection till we reached our caravan, unless something untoward had happened to our caravan, God forbid. As luck would have it the caravan ahead was ours. We were received with shouts of joy.

Having heard that the dacoits had been sighted, they had circumvented that village and made their way through another route, spending the night in a tight group keeping a constant vigil for dacoits or marauders.

One week later we reached Imphal. All arrangements were being made to send arriving refugees to their respective home towns. They gave each of us two inland letters to write and inform the family that we were safe. I sent one letter to my father and one to my cousin Meenakshi.

THAT BEAUTIFUL BROOCH IS WITH MY SISTER IN LAW.
