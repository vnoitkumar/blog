There stood a lonely speck of white

On yonder peak at the mountain’s height

Forlorn and deserted, not a soul around

Overlooking the brown, arid ground

What spurred this tiny structure?

Was it a lone artist carving his sculpture?

Or one nursing a broken heart

When the loved one did depart?

Was it a shrine for a beloved God?

Or a sepulcher to mourn one’s dear dead

Was it an old king’s lookout post?

Where weary eyes watched the coast

For stealthy armies, charging stallions,

Clanking swords, war cries of battalions

Or was it the refuge of a girl hapless

Who dared cross caste norms so callous?

And gave away her tender heart

To one who was a class apart

I trudged up the mountain, worn out

For I was plagued with doubt

I stood facing the ancient wall

I rued on what did befall

The wall gazed back in silence

It whispered, “I hold stories timeless!

The stories of those now lifeless

I shall speak not of them good or ill

Their memories I must not reveal

Leave them with me in peace”

I strode down, feeling deeply tranquil

To the walls I was strangely thankful.
