***TO A CONSCIENCE FROM INNOCENCE***



I had the privilege of watching the movie version of “To Kill A Mocking Bird” in 1966 (early teens, let’s not get into more details). I commend and admire the teachers who screened it for us – within four years of its release in the US and six years of the publication of the novel. Impressionable and ingenuous as I was, I remember coming away from the film quite disillusioned: the story of a black American, wrongly accused of raping a white woman, and found guilty – in spite of it being proved that the accused was not capable of such a crime on account of a physical disability; before Atticus Finch, his suave attorney, can file an appeal against the verdict, the accused in shot and killed. The dramatic scene in the courtroom when the accused could not lift his left arm has stayed in my mind, ever since – an example of living proof sacrificed to bigoted racism. I read the book much later, going into the nuances of the law (Lee was a law graduate), and the casual life around racial discrimination, whether black or white, or even white trash.

The narrator is a young girl, Jean Louise Finch (nicknamed Scout), as she grows from the age of 6 to around 9 and her observations of the behaviour of her neighbours, described amidst childish pranks and adventures (including the clandestine entry into Boo Radley’s house which is always barred) with her brother Jeremy and neighbour, Dill. Though still a child, she sees through the women who appear sincere guardians of morality but hide their deeply racist attitudes.



She is the daughter of Atticus – who, though a fictional figure, has apparently had a tremendous influence on the behaviour of lawyers and judges in the US for around half a century. The novel is known for various aspects of excellence: literary, social, legal; display of courage and compassion; loss of innocence; and the gender roles among the whites as well as blacks in the southern states of the US. Predictably, the novel (and its author) has its share of critics but the 40 million copies sold worldwide, in over 30 translations is a witness in itself to its universal appeal; the movie grossed over $ 20 million over a budget of $ 2 million – and got an Academy Award for Gregory Peck who acted as Atticus. 

After this huge success, and a few interviews thereon, Harper Lee withdrew from the public gaze – until she decided to release “Go Set a Watchman” in 2015 – at the ripe old age of around 88 (which gives me hope yet!) A strange kind of controversy surrounded this publication. It is said that this was actually her first book, but after some alterations and repeated discussions with publishers, agents, lawyers … the second draft was published as “To Kill A Mockingbird”. So, although “Go Set A Watchman” was her first work, it came out after 55 years of the other novel.

Having read the “Watchman” over the last week, I thought it would be good idea to compare the two novels. The first thing I noticed was that “Watchman” was narrated in the third person, though Scout hovers largely on every page of the book, “Mockingbird” is narrated by Scout herself. She grows up holding her father, Atticus, as the idol of human behaviour – he always stood by what is right: his definition of “courage” is: "when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what".

“Mockingbird” was released at a time when the civil rights movement was at its peak – in fact, there are some who say that if the civil rights movement saw any degree of success, it was due to “Mockingbird” – it could be the other way round too! “Watchman” on the other hand, is a sad reminder that in spite of almost a hundred years since Gettysburg (the book is said to have been written in the 1950s), the emancipation proclamation was yet a piece of paper; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr still had to “dream” in August, 1963. There is a scene in “Mockingbird” where Atticus shoots a rabid dog: Atticus’ body language as he aims his gun is reminiscent of George Orwell’s “Shooting An Elephant” as he acquiesces to the popular image of the British Civil Servant as the “rescuer”; he shoots the elephant, knowing there was an alternative … There is a theory, however, that the incident of the mad dog may have actually symbolised racism itself, and how summarily it was dealt with.

While “Mockingbird” refers to the innocent, and therefore, restraint from “killing” it, the title of “Watchman” is derived from a biblical quotation (Isaiah 21:6) – and is an admonition to “have a conscience”. What is implied is: have a conscience of your own. Don’t hook your conscience to that of someone else’s morals – it’s almost like the old British saying that each generation needs to experience for itself that the stove is hot: we need to touch the pipes, feel the heat, at the risk of scalding ourselves … no experience and/or advice of the older generation can replace that. “Watchman” tumbles through the shock – and sorrow – of Scout’s transformation from that absolute, black-and-white (no pun there) world of her childhood to those many shades of grey that she is suddenly woken up to, and is confused, irritated, frustrated. And therefore, what is truly gripping – and shocking – ***AND*** appealing – about “Watchman” is the new image of Atticus Finch. Once accused of being a “nigger-lover” in “Mockingbird”, he is now seen as one who tolerates racism and segregation, as he sits through a Citizens’ Council meeting where a speaker spews unmitigated venom against the blacks. Scout, thoroughly disillusioned with this idol-turned-demon, wants to run away… the child who had laughingly, playfully, told the story of “Mockingbird” is now an adult who has yet to set a watchman for herself. The symbol that Atticus was, remains unmoved against Scout’s scathing, thoughtless diatribe… until she is brought to her senses by Atticus’ brother, and learns of the compromises that make up their life in Maycomb, Alabama, as elsewhere among human beings. The real story of the loss of innocence is, therefore, seen more in “Watchman” than in “Mockingbird”.

At the end, the reader has to decide if the story builds up heroes or exposes fools, and which category does each of us fall in.
