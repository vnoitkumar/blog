We are all God's children\
Free spirited\
In thought and action\
And blessed with life

When we look around us\
We see happiness and laughter\
As we look further\
There's misery and pain too

And we think to ourselves\
What life takes us through\
We exist to help one another\
But we are helpless too

To relieve the pain and suffering\
Of terminal illnesses , there's more than a few\
We hear of a friend in the fourth stage\
A child beside his ailing father

An elder with organs failing\
Surviving with palliative care\
But friends and family alike\
Pintheir faith on hope

Human spirit rekindled\
Resilience is our forte\
Basic instincts to the fore\
The afflicted get on with their lives\
On a schedule they cannot ignore

Then we start asking the questions\
We get philosophical\
And curious too\
Aren't we all God's children\
Who survived the plague and flu

But put to the test again\
With Covid too\
Precious lives lost\
Time seems to stand still

Through all the struggle\
Looking to the future with hope\
We stand up strong\
Wiser with time

Hopeful\
That this too shall pass\
And get on with life\
Blessed as we are\
Humans forever
