Her face jumped on to my LinkedIn page.

Are you the same …, she asked.

Was I? I wondered.

My name was what she knew me as.

But I wasn’t the same.

She had changed me. Ages ago.

The last time we had met was in a little restaurant on Khodadad Circle – the pavement glistening with the night’s rain. She had wanted to meet me urgently. I had been writing to her regularly, and maybe I was wearing more than my heart on my sleeve. But she wanted to meet. Funny, she wanted to meet me before her college timing – early morning around 07.30 – I had to do a bit of juggling with my college timings too, but there I was, all agog.

She had a forced kind of smile when she saw me from across the road – and I felt a cold shiver up my spine. …and while the tea was on its way, she started telling me about this guy in Brazil and … I didn’t hear anything after that.

If that was the case,

my mind was in a whirl,

if that was the case,

she could have warned me …

I gulped the tea down, paid the waiter, and

told her that it’s fine,

that I wouldn’t want to impose myself on her,

escorted her out of the restaurant hall,

and I walked into the drizzle and didn’t look back…

and allowed the rain to wash my face.

The rain water was stinging my eyes.

And here she was on LinkedIn asking me if I was the same after some 30 years. I confirmed, warily, tentatively, and was rewarded with a torrent of information about whatever it was she was doing at present and whatever else that came to her mind, on LinkedIn and WhatsApp.

I couldn’t allow this to disturb my life now.

In more than one message,

I reminded her of that rainy morning in Bombay

and slid into some meaningless banter.

She reminded me that she was just 17.

I remembered though

at 17 she had settled on someone across the oceans

and continents.

She would be in Mumbai soon, she informed me, and do you think we could meet for an hour? I thought over it. What good could come out of it? And I wasn’t in Bombay anymore but I said, yes, it was possible. I was there, again juggling my schedule. A return air-ticket in my pocket. 

An hour before the meeting, my phone hums in response to a WhatsApp message:

I am sorry I can’t come.

I am leaving on a quick trip to Goa in the afternoon

with my husband and my mother.

Do you think we can meet for,

say,

5 minutes at the airport?

It wasn’t raining in Bombay that day.

I looked up at the sun and it stung as badly as the rain.
