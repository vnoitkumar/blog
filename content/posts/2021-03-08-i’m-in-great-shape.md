When you go for a walk on the beach in the morning, especially during weekends, you see this poster offering to check your Mass Fat Index, no, I think it is Fat Mass Index (FMI) for FREE! There is a tall, slim man standing beside it. How would it look if there was a short, pudgy man instead? Would anyone check their FMI, I wondered, smiling. This was the latest health fad, I realized. Earlier we used to see people standing in front of tables offering “*Arugampul juice*” for diabetics and men with the boot of their car open offering “farm fresh” *keerai and katharikai.* In my mind the term “farm fresh” itself is associated with an over production of *katharikais.*

I looked around wondering who would need to check their FMI. Not many of the senior citizens. Obviously they were there to exercise their aging muscles and creeking bones. Definitely not those smart young men wearing sleeveless t-shirts displayling their rippling muscles. Either they were there to enjoy the sea breeze, catch up with friends or just show off. Would that Junoesque woman over there need to check her FMI? I must admit right here that I included this sentence simply because I wanted to use the word ever since I read in Amitav Ghosh’s latest book that Mrs. Burham was a ‘Junoesque’ lady. Coming back to the subject, I realized that it was the middle aged and not-yet middle aged women who fell into the FMI checking category. And the men? They put on football paunches and will need a Paunch Measuring Index instead!

The other day, I was going through the usual mad search for material for a costume. This time, for our very own Meera, the ‘Meera Ke Prabhu Giridhara Gopala’ one, and a few props that were needed for a Temple procession. We were rushing around between shops in Luz and Mylapore tank to find the right shade of orange/pink with just enough dull gold or dull silver border for Meera and what was described to us as, “Y’ know that guy amma, who carries that stick with a colourfully embroidered spade on it, big o.k, don’t forget that, and follows the palanquin in the Temple festival?” I was desperately winding my way through a profussion of haphazardly parked two-wheelers outside Giri Traders in search of the ‘stick-with-the-spade” when I heard a voice call out, “Ma’am.” It was the FMI guy! Here, outside the Kapali Temple, in front of the “Everything Religious under One Roof” Giri Traders.

“Hey Man,” I called out, pointing to my wholesome hips. “Can’t you see the Fat Mass? Does it have to be *measured* also?” and I hurriedly climbed the steps to the shop.

Why are people obsessed with Fat Mass Index and Body Types? It’s this Kareena Kapoor and her size zero. People fooled themselves into thinking that she achieved it by living on love for Saif Ali Khan and the fish-scented sea breeze in Bandra. It is only now after she stated that she can’t exist without her roti, dhal and lassi and that she does indulge in a sweet quite often that Vidhya Balan has been accepted for her good looks and not only for her acting talent.

“But this is not your body-type, amma,” they say, looking at the quite hefty me. “The doctors don’t know anything. You **can** lose weight if you set your mind to it.” For Heavens’ Sake, does anyone have the same body-type throughout their lives? But for a few exceptions, most women are slim when young, not-so-slim after child birth and put on girth after middle age. What you actually can’t fight is your DNA and if Fat Mass is the family type you can’t beat it. You may be less so or more so but be sure, it will show! Every woman in my family has thunder thighs and has started slowing down by the time they are sixty. I still stand erect and walk briskly, so what’s the FMI complex all about?

Why do people feel that it’s their basic right to make personal comments about us. “You’ve put on weight,” “Your face is beginning to look like a pumpkin,” “You’ve become shapeless,” ---- Hey Man, I am not planning to participate in the Miss India Contest. I’ve been a Mrs for over 45 years! Do we look them up and down and say, “Do I see a two inch increase in those love handles?” or “What happened? Has the effect of that ‘Most Effective Diet’ worn off?”

I wish I could quote statistics that say, “A larger percentage of hefty people are healthy while most slim people suffer from malnutrition,” because I firmly believe that it is true. But like every article on healthy food habits tells you, “It is more important to be healthy and happy than to try to force yourself to look slimmer and younger than your age.” As for me, I’m in great shape and that shape is round!
