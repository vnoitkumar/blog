**Astonished**, amazed, surprised am I

**S**pirited and curious at every turn,

**T**he colours of the morning eye

**O**r the evening skies e’en as they burn.                           

**N**o! That excitement shall ne’er die!

In clouds that cling to the mountainside

**S**ee I much wonder and delight

**H**ow merrily do I tromp beside

My friends who’ve won their heart’s delight

**Each** day an adventure does provide

**N**ights do our morrows garnish

**T**his life never ceases to **astonish**
