Nature drew out her Pallette and paintbrush

And with graceful strokes she wrought a blush

On the beautiful blue canopy above

Deft were her strokes, a labour of love

The brilliant blue kissed the orangish pink

Merging together in perfect sync

The beautiful tree with autumn leaves

Scant aware of the frame it weaves

The blue and pink incandescent sky

This Masterpiece of nature so captivates the eye

She is her own undisputed mistress

Her palette holds colours both dark and sensuous

Placid and peaceful in her serenity

Unless driven to rightful notoriety

When human ravishing gets too hard to bear

Anger aroused, she makes us cower in fear

Her brush stokes then birth fearfulness

Painting angry waves that crush her tormentors

Her core breaks open as her molten anger erupts

And she swallows all that her equilibrium disrupts

And then will the anger slowly wane

She forgives the victims of avarice so vain

Her balance she will find again

Life goes on, but she will forever reign
