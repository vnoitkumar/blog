The name is reminiscent of cool and dusty Dehra Dun and the quietly regal Shimla (which according to the travel brochure “holds onto its colonial legacy with ferocity”), not to forget the exclusive charm of Mussoorie – all on their lofty Himalayan perches, containing, as Ruskin Bond says, “worlds upon worlds \[of stories] within them”. Bond’s tales conjure up the winding roads that carry you up 7500 feet above MSL (and the rugged footpaths in between), as you hear the forests whistling their eerie tunes, or feel the gentle breeze that rustles through the bushes, and the flowers that bring out the stillness within… The easy simple style that holds your attention, lets a group of children on mischief bent in a neighbourhood orchard delightfully drift you away to your own similar exploits in some distant, archived memories, converting those ordinary exploits into a wonder-filled nostalgic narrative. And then there’s a bunch of kids “racing” their pet beetles! Oh, the simple joys of childhood before the onslaught of psycho-numbing electronic pastimes!

There are twenty-one stories in this present selection. Bond, though not a mystery writer, has a story here of cold-blooded murder, premeditated and executed with finesse, accompanied by a mild and maidenly attempt at blackmail! Told in the classic style of detective fiction – red-herrings and all – the events linger on while you read the rest of the stories. Then there are mysteries related to eccentric old dames grown more eccentric in their feeling of abandonment. You are left with the same bewilderment and confusion as the young, wide-eyed narrator. We also have a few of those overt little snippets, short tales of rumours and gossip that small towns, particularly hill stations, tend to collect: “Some Hill Station Ghosts”, and “A Hill Station’s Vintage Murders”. With clouds languidly clinging to the rugged mountainsides, the lingering mists, and the slender twists of smoke that stretch out of tiny chimneys down in the valleys … ghosts are but a spine-tingling whisper away. 

This rarefied atmosphere also lends itself to wistful adventures of the heart. In a semi-autobiographical mood, Bond speaks of the girl he had seen at Deoli Station and another woman he meets unexpectedly at Shamli. Bond clarifies that though there are five towns called Deoli and at least one called Shamli in various parts of North India, the towns in these stories are purely imaginary. The characters however come alive, right through the 5 a.m. mist and the dimly lit railway station, surrounded by jungle, where the tracks are just about visible in the faint light of dawn. While the Deoli meeting would place the narrator on the edge of a beautiful romance, at that stage where expectation and hope are all that there is, and all that is likely to be, the Shamli meeting speaks of a full-blown affair, sometime, not very long ago – with feeble, futile attempts in the now, to re-ignite the old spark. Touching tales of what might have been, if only… Both tales remind you of the Amy Winehouse song: *“All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew, and this regret I’ve got accustomed to.”*

Equally touching (and suspiciously autobiographical) is “The Funeral” where a man dies leaving behind an only son of around 9 years – and a wife who is “hundreds of miles away with another husband”. All the resentment of a nine-year-old contained in those three words, “with another husband”. This level of rancour is not discernible anywhere in his other stories. But it is momentary, as the little boy knows for sure that his father will find a way out of the grave. Poignant.

“The Visitor”, “A Magic Oil”, and “The Tail of the Lizard” are stories that combine folklore and a spirit of adventure – coupled with that dreary search of the Male of The Species for the ultimate in sexual prowess. “A Good Place for Trees” surprisingly drifts into the interpretation of moles depending on their location on the human body. The narrator (Bond himself?) is said to have a mole on his tummy “and that’s very lucky”; he also has one under his armpit “which implies fame”. This should be an interesting profession though – this search for moles on interesting parts of the body, their meanings being incidental.

But on a serious note, Bond says that it’s courage, not luck that takes us through to the end of the road. Be that as it may, he has a way of converting ordinary events of daily life into delectable takeaways. Each of the stories brings out the simple lives led among the Himalayan foothills, the uniqueness of hill stations – like “Bus Stop Pipalnagar” with its delicate balance between attachment and freedom, the old yielding place to the new.

But what strikes you most is the warmth of human relationships (see the dedication after you’ve read the stories), the quaint interdependence of apparently unrelated characters – and the *humour*, wry at times as when the little boy at his father’s funeral (“Of what use are we to God when we are dead?”), or when the woman, who, waiting for the clock to strike thirteen, kills a passer-by in her aborted suicide attempt. Macabre, you’d say. But the smiles keep fluttering in and out of your consciousness... and you don’t mind reading the stories all over again.
