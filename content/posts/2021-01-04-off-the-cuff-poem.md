He sauntered along as so often before

He loved the clean air of the place;

A street he had trodden for years heretofore,

Of a sudden, just seemed full of grace.

He waited, just hoping she’d come out the door,

Or a glimpse at the windows would do;

He hobbled around, went up to her door,

What a delightful fear it was too!

His fingers, all thumbs, couldn’t get the bell push;

He struggled, they seemed like a ton,

His breath came out in gasps and a “hoosh”

This one-sided love was no fun.

Rightly ‘tis said True Love doth endure

With two hearts a-beating as one

But when it’s just one, it just has no cure

But poetry …

… as you get unravelled, undone.
