**BACK FROM THE BRINK**

I have taken my time reviewing this book because it is the story of a good friend – who has come back with a renewed strength in his positive thinking. It is a story of coming back from the brink of life (I think the expression “brink of death” misses the point).

Without meaning to be cynical, I would like to ponder over how the philosopher in all of us is awakened by death and thoughts of death? Listen to people at any funeral, where “ephemerality of life” takes precedence in the discussion; some may stray into our purpose on this earth; others think of the after-life and its possibilities; and still others would head for the nearest source of the local “spiritual” assistance – and this has no reference whatsoever to Tennyson’s crossing “the bar”.

A friend of mine posted the following on Facebook, apparently after a brief stay in a covid hospital: “Let's join hands and make this world a better place. Not many of us will survive this holocaust … Let's break all barriers and make that little difference in whichever small way we can.” Inspiring, heart-warming and, for once, an “original” statement. Normally, quotations, in all their banality abound – and one is amused. Until the time the doctor tells you, that it is you who don't have much time left...

Jyoti Prakash Dash, a colleague and good friend, now Senior General Manager of the Mint in Hyderabad, was thus direly informed by his oncologist.

His response? A book with pithy wisdom, sharp observations ... and a clarity of thought that, I am sure, is rare in such situations. Understandably, JP (as I prefer to call him fondly), has recorded an emotional outburst to the gut-wrenching information he received; he has also described with great love, admiration and gratitude, the medical treatment which he was given, and the unlimited emotional support he received from known and unexpected sources. One cannot but admire the outstandingly positive nature of his reaction to such a scary situation.

Understandably, again, this outburst, being highly emotional, is not, (and neither is it expected to be) sequential, logical, and detached. One can imagine JP at his laptop, on the threshold of full recovery, recalling each incident, each moment, when he received the overwhelming support that actually brought him back … and with each such moment, feeling that deep and almost-inexpressible gratitude bursting within him – towards God and his handiwork through the doctors and nurses and relatives and friends … and it didn’t matter in the least, that he felt those emotions again and again.

And in that feeling of unalloyed gratitude, JP goes on to lavish praise on the editor and publisher. The problem with JP is that he is, and always has been, a very generous soul. Perhaps this encounter has only made him more so. But I feel that that the editor / publisher have an innate duty to make a presentation of the matter, which in their expected level of experience and expertise, that would make the book more readable. The lapses of proofreading, paragraphing and logical-sequential presentation have all been given the go-by, and this is inexcusable. Perhaps that is the difference between reputed publishers and … others.

But the fact remains: JP, though initially disturbed by the information, stood up to the challenge and won. What comes out of his book is the old Viktor Frankl statement that we can do nothing about what happens to us – but we can control, decide, direct what we can do about it.
