*In silent wonder, Mario watches the restrained might of the Arabian Sea as it rubs itself, almost languorously, insatiably, against the rough granite of The Pier. And mesmerised by the incessant churning of the turbid waters, he imagines the pier itself afloat, adrift and free of the subcontinent – his mind in strange harmony with the rhythmic, endless foreplay of granite and foam – and would, like Byron, be musing there an hour alone, but for the impatience of his companion, Rafique.*

*They had decided to catch up, Rafique and Mario, thanks to a chance meeting on LinkedIn. The gap of forty years had left them strangers though … little in common now. Rafique had turned a successful owner of a ship-breaking facility in Kolkata, and was on a brief visit to Mumbai, where he had a branch office; Mario, a retired civil servant, also on a brief visit from his native village in Goa. At this exclusive corner of Mumbai, his salt-and-pepper hair (or whatever was left of it) tousled beyond repair Mario turned to look at Rafique, who still retained his full head of hair, blackened with some dye that had affected the texture of his facial skin.*

*With the sky splashed with awesome aggressive shades of grey, holding dark promises of relief from a badly delayed monsoon, Rafique had cleared his throat once too often for Mario to ignore him.* 

*“Forty years!” He said, as if they were continuing a conversation. “The last time we were here together … d’you remember Harry’s wedding? … we were also waiting for Pappu?”*

*“I don’t remember that. Isn’t he the chap from Chembur? …used to manage a book-shop?” the frown on his face showed Rafique’s efforts to recall the wedding. There was a lot that he had forgotten about those months. A lot he wouldn’t care to remember.*

*Mario nodded with a nostalgic smile. They moved towards the cafeteria.*

**Sunday, the 27th of May 1979.**

Of the six friends, four had received their LL.B. degrees in the previous year; Mario and Paul had joined senior advocates and got into law practice. Interestingly, Mario had cleared the UPSC exams while Paul had passed the RBI exams; Pappu had completed about two years of managing the bookshop that had grown larger and more popular under his expertise; Dominic continued with the company he had been working with during his college years but had been called to join the State Bank of India somewhere in the interior of Maharashtra. Rafique had become a bit of recluse and Harry of course was getting married today.

Harry (no one enquired about his original “Indian” name), who had been in love with Farida for around two years, had announced last month, that they were going to get married. He had booked a suite in the Palace Hotel, where the friends would meet, and thence they would all proceed to The Club where the reception was to be held.

Farida was the daughter of a leading medico in Bombay and lived in a pent house on Worli Sea Face, while Harry, originally from Gujarat, had come down from New York where his parents had a leather goods business. He had a room in the hostel meant for foreign students, near the college and none of them really knew what course of study he had undertaken to be entitled to that accommodation. Farida was about 5 feet 8 inches and looked like a belly dancer on stage, swaying in wafts of some costly perfume that one couldn’t quite place. And there was this air of the ingénue about her that was attractive, almost charming. She believed, for instance, that Africa was a single country and when told it wasn’t, she insisted: “but then it *should* be, don’t you think?” and laughed her tinkling, confident laugh. They were amused, indulgent, while Harry, scarlet-faced, joined in the good-humoured banter.

On the other hand, Harry with his receding hairline and indeterminate age carried the relationship as an embellishment to his persona. Though there was no public smooching or inter-locking of fingers, when they walked together on the narrow, dusty, flagstone footpaths of Churchgate, they seemed to float along together – and one could almost see the little red hearts spiralling around them as in a comic strip of Archie and Veronica.

So, after the brief ‘ceremony’ that morning, in the presence of the Sub-registrar of Marriages (who on the promise of adequate compensation, felt obliged to carry the enormous register to the pent house, and dispense with the publication of the mandatory ‘notices’) which all of them attended, they were to meet for the reception in the evening.

Mario was the first to arrive in his three-piece pin-stripe. This was the second time he was using the suit; the first time was for the UPSC interview. His father, an Office Superintendent with the Bombay Port Trust, had insisted that he should wear it for the interview. He had reluctantly taken it, wondering how it would be to travel in that kind of dress in an auto-rickshaw in Delhi. Not to forget the April heat – but, he recalled, he had been quite comfortable. The hallowed corridors of Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road were apparently meant for formal dressing. And he was grateful to his Dad for the suit. It had somehow boosted his confidence and he had performed well in the presence of the five-member interview board.

But his entry this evening into the Palace Hotel was a different thing altogether: he had entered the premises, clutching the wedding invitation in sweaty fingers as if it were an identity card or an entry ticket without which he feared he may be turned out.

There was a perpetual awkwardness about him generally, giving the impression of hiding a great and terrible secret behind that poker face; something he was afraid would be revealed if he looked you straight in the eye; and his movements whether physically or in expressing an opinion were almost tentative, always wary of intruding into somebody else’s territory. It had the effect of endearing him to but a few of his classmates. The fact that he spoke very little of Hindi (and even that with a stilted accent) kept several of his classmates at a not necessarily respectful distance. So, if anyone made the smallest of overtures of friendship, he would accept them without much hesitation. Those who came close and knew him well also knew how far they could go with him without his taking umbrage at the slightest perception of an affront – his response being of total stoppage of communication. And then there was that shyness of almost pathological proportions, something not everyone had time and patience for. He was acutely conscious of it; it grew with the years and he carried it like Philip Carey’s clubfoot, ever-present, ever-embarrassing, leaving him hesitant beyond the limits of age and learning.

He was blessed, however, with a razor-sharp mind, and a discomfiting habit of reading anything that came his way. His interests ranged from Ayn Rand (she was the rage in any case those days) to Jiddu Krishnamurthy to Georgette Heyer and, a copy of that apparently meaningless narrative which went by the intriguing name of *Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* was seen in his hands for weeks together*.* All that reading was rarely exposed because the moment a discussion started, he would experience painful mental blocks; but when he did participate, he would give the impression that he had to see the end of it, in his favour. Pappu encouraged him to read more books, including books on self-management, which he managed to get from various libraries; and was a great help in his preparations for the UPSC exams.

But that evening, Pappu was still on the way. As Mario was there with three of the others, Harry decided to start out for The Club with them. They entered with the confidence born of camaraderie, as if they were frequenters there, and went directly to the Pier where the reception was to be held. The sunlight had given way to the harsh, golden spots that lined the roads along the bay. They could hear the constant rustle of the tide, and the darkening skies gave an odd feeling of a disturbed stillness upon the waters; the soft lights reflecting off the bleached table cloths added a dash of melancholy … The friends sat together at one of the tables and watched as the other guests tromped about, scotch-in-hand. Mario was amused as he and his friends looked around like prairie dogs over the unfamiliar surroundings. And amidst all this, there hung a strong sense of expectancy; their minds awhirl with their own dreams and career plans for the morrow and its uncertainties.

What each of them knew deep in their career-oppressed minds that night, and none of them would care to admit, was that this would, in fact, be the last time the friends would be together. Each one of them had that vague, gnawing feeling about it and there was that slight heaviness in their breath, in their talk, as they tried to be as light-hearted as usual; Farida and Harry would soon leave for the US of A and each of this motley group of friends would go their own way. It was in that state of mind, agog with thoughts of what the future held for each of them, that they parted; the goodbyes consciously ebullient, with the fear that this *bonhomie* may suddenly end … the major discomfort at that point of time arising only from the abundance of Scotch in gullets as yet unaccustomed to the ingestion of alcohol.

......

And so it was, that the friends went their different ways.

It was the year in which it snowed in the Sahara Desert (yes, for half an hour!); the year **Margaret Thatcher** became the first lady Prime Minister of UK, while the Shah of Iran and Idi Amin of Uganda were both deposed with different world reactions. Against the background of the **USSR invading Afghanistan and the Three Mile Island Nuclear Accident** in the US, **Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter** signed **SALT II;** the IRA assassinated Lord Mountbatten and Pakistan executed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. And small-pox was officially declared as eradicated from the planet.

It was around two years since the emergency imposed by Mrs. Indira Gandhi in India had ended with the near-euphoric transfer of control to the Janata Party. Shortly, Prime Minister Morarji Desai would hand over charge to Chaudhari Charan Singh – Mario would read about that at the National Academy in Mussoorie, Paul in Nagpur and Dominic in Bhandara. Pappu would discuss it freely with the customers at his shop. The brief romance of the Indian electorate with a non-Congress government would soon end and Mrs. Gandhi would return with a landslide majority … but we are getting ahead of the story.
