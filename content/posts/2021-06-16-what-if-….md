**What if**

*The world’s gone dark*

*And clouds smother the sun*

*While gloom rides relentlessly on*

*Hang on!*

*<br/>*

*What if*

*The goal’s far yet*

*The tide flows strong and fast*

*And your strength is ebbing away*

*Row on!*

*<br/>*

*What if*

*You’re on your knee*

*she spurns your earnest pledge*

*the solitaire's covered with gloom*

*Press on!*

*<br/>*

*What if*

*your bones do creak*

*your breath goes short and hard*

*and your muscles become too stiff*

*Don’t quit!*

*<br/>*

*The gloom*

*Will pass, the goal*

*You’ll reach, the girl you’ll win*

*Your health will up and improve, if*

*You will!*
