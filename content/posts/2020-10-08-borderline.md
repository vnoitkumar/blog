The edge of the precipice. The borderline between hurtling into the abyss and standing safe though tantalisingly close to the edge. We stand teetering on the brink. How long will we last? She? Me?\
\
We both kept putting a leg across the border and pulling it back, Aparna with her physical ailment and me with my mental health. With a badly dysfunctional heart since birth, she didn't stand a chance, or so the doctors said. Treat her like a dainty China doll in a glass box, they said. And we did. We remained on the edge\
of the precipice, teetering on the brink.\
\
There's the other borderline. The one of fun, of happiness, of unmitigated joy. We went across to that borderline too. Time and again, till the precipice laid claim. A pneumonia, a hospitalisation, a drip. But she gets over it quick, powered by a mental strength way beyond the physical as the other borderline beckons.\
\
There's School to finish, Computer courses to complete, a job, friends and so much more. Life has so much in store. Yet, life also takes its toll. Pushes you towards the precipice. This time it's me. I'm not depressed, I'm happy, I claim. But no, depression is a medical name. And yes, it does push me to the edge of the precipice. Now I too stand teetering on the brink.\
\
Hand in hand, we decide to fight to remain on the right side of life. Movies, Mahjong, write a book or two, invite friends over for a meal. Somehow our happiness we're determined to steal. We managed to brush aside our woes and enjoy life to the hilt. But there's no escaping it, the balance started to tilt.\
\
First a non-surgical procedure and a period of calm. We planned short trips that would cause her no harm. But trouble creeps in like a silent thief. She now needs oxygen to help her breathe. As for me, often depression raises its ugly head. I just deal with it and let it pass. And carry on as if nothing happened at all. Though the precipice pulled with all its might, we managed to keep the the other borderline in sight.\
\
She needed a hysterectomy, there was no choice between 'to do or not to do.' It was a decided risk we all knew. I sat chewing my nails while my daughter chanted. A respite for her, God granted. We were shocked at the sight of the fibroid. How did she manage with such a huge mass inside her? This was the fortitude with which she stoically stayed on the borderline she desired.\
\
For a period of time we remained suspended. Between the precipice and the border intended. Neither could exert a strong enough force nor could she move towards the side she chose. But soon enough came this huge draught that filled us with a chill in our hearts. She'll need a heart-lung transplant, they said. It's the only way out.\
\
The surgery was done. A success. We heaved a sigh of relief. She was transferred to the ward. We made plans for a new life for her. To regain the joy that had been deluding her. Death cheats. It sends a short moment of light before plunging the knife. Having crossed over the precipice she exudes a peaceful calm.\
\
I let out a scream that makes me feel as if my head will shatter into a thousand pieces but no sound escapes my lips. I am left behind, still teetering on the brink.
