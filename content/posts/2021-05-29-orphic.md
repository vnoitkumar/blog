*The blue whispers of the sky,*

*An eternal promise of love*

*That adorns and welcomes life.*

*<br/>*

*The horizon kissing the sea*

*Drowns the burden of reality.*

*Life sways to the breeze's lullaby*

*That lits the voyage in a melody.*

*<br/>*

*Beyond the vast wild blue seas*

*The Mind is flooded with illusions,*

*While heart wanders in an endless quest.*

*<br/>*

*In the darkest of nights*

*Moments of still silence*

*Awakens the dawn within.*

*An impending sense of divinity.*

*<br/>*

*The soul travels on forever,*

*But the life halts at the shore.*
