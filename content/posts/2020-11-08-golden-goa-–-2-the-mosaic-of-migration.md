The awesome act of “creation” of a coastal strip alongside the western ghats, at the hands of Parshuram (which I had alluded to Golden Goa – 1) is supported by geological evidence; the Konkan belt did rise up from the seabed, around 10,000 BCE, as a result of tectonic movements related to the Deccan Plateau. No wonder then that the Mauryan term for Goa was Aparanta – “the land before the end”.

However, the Mahabharata knew it as Goparashtra or Govarashtra; the Skanda Purana mentions Gomanchala; other variations were Gopakapuri, Gopakapattinam, Govapuri, Gomantak – sometimes referring to the land, sometimes to its capital city. Apparently, it was a land of cows, evidenced these days by the nonchalant bovine take-over of the national highways as they comfortably ruminate on times gone by. Today, of course, Goa is known for its beaches and little else, and, of course, the “laid back” life so wistfully framed in W.H. Davies’ poem: “Leisure”! (Remember: “*What is this life if full of care …*”)

### But it was not always so. It was a hard life in the early human settlements as they started off with hunting-gathering, during the Lower Palaeolithic Age: the petroglyphs that I had referred to belong to this period. Turf wars against wild animals and humans were a matter of survival. There were tribes of Austric origin such as the Kols (believed to be from Gujarat), Mundaris and Kharvis who lived on hunting, fishing and a primitive form of agriculture – the Gaudas/Gaudis and Kunbis of today are possibly the descendants of the ancient Mundaris. A large number of words in the Konkani language can be traced back to these “prehistoric” tribes. This period also saw the ingress of the Proto-Australoid tribe known as the Konkas – who gave the name to the region: Kongvan or Konkan. They worshipped a mother goddess in the form of an anthill (known as *Santer* or *Roen*). Later settlers of Aryan and Dravidian origin also adopted anthill worship, (translated into Prakrit *Santara*) – which still continues in Goa.

There is a theory that the Bhargava tribe of Gujarat migrated to Goa – in the misty past! They are said to have been connected to the Phrygians of Asia Minor, who may have started their marine expeditions before the Mahabharata war. Other tribes like the Angiras (who claim descendance from Vishwakarma) also migrated to Goa during this time. It was around 2200 BCE that the Sumerians established trade links with Goa, and many of them settled here. They left their mark on Goa in several areas – agricultural field measurements used even today are believed to be of Sumerian origin, the measures do not match with the systems in the rest of the subcontinent; and so was the temple-building style, the devadasi system; the language, forms of entertainment, and games. But the most impressive and lasting idea they left us with is the system of village administration.

The seaborne community of Phoenicians had extensive settlements in Goa around 1775 BCE.

The Harappan port town of Lothal (in present day Gujarat) was by this time losing its battle against the Arabian Sea; its inhabitants moved to Goa around 1600 BCE. While the next few centuries continued to see heavy immigration, the major historical bump thereafter is when Chandragupta Maurya incorporated the territory into his western coastal province leaving an imprint of Prakrit on the early formation of the Konkani language. During this period, a native Goan named Purna/Punna, considered a direct disciple of Buddha, popularised Buddhism in Goa – also converting the warring tribes into pockets of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.

Thereafter, Goa moved into the Christian Era with the Satavahanas (noted for their powerful maritime force, and their trade with Greece and Rome through Goa) who had broken away from the decadent Mauryas, and ruled Goa till about 100 CE.

[](<>)This extraordinary mixture of hugely diverse cultures, races, customs, practices, religious beliefs, and dialects led to a colourful society controlled and guided by an oligarchic form of local administration far superior to any such system anywhere in the world. But more about that later!
