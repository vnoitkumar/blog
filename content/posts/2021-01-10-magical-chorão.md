Having come back to Goa after four generations of wandering around in the sub-continent, we feel the need to absorb as much of Goa as possible, within as short a time as possible! Perhaps it goes beyond mere sights-seeing. Perhaps it is a yearning to find the Golden Goa that was “fed” to us as we grew up, so far away and yet ever-so-close. When short summer vacations only served to whet our appetite for more …

So, when time and weather permit, we are off to see places, with little organised groups, or with a friend or two, or on our own. Recently, we discovered the magic of Chorão, an island in the River Mandovi. We learnt later that the locals have strongly opposed any kind of bridge across the waters; everyone seems to be happy about the ferry connection.

We left at 5.45 in the morning (it’s about 20 km from my residence, and about a kilometre or so from Panaji), braving the cool breeze that awakened in us a unique kind of alertness, a sort of anticipated excitement. First for the ferry point at Ribandar. The sunrise on the Mandovi was nothing less than a poet’s delight, supplemented by the stupendous scenic beauty as we approached the island.

The pre-Portuguese name of the island was Chuddamani (for “diamond” in Sanskrit), but the irrepressible feeling of entering into a cool and pleasant time-warp is something that needs to be experienced. Little mud-houses with thatched roofs huddle together in hamlets, co-existing harmoniously with white-stuccoed churches and colourful “Portuguese” houses. In that frozen time-span, short and bucolic, the island was also known as *Ilha dos Fidalgos* (or Island of the Nobles – but the expression also refers to the poor-but-proud-and-comfortable!Terrible times struck the island with the plague of 1766 and its relapse in 1878 which all but wiped out the population of the island – thousands succumbed, many fled to safer locations …it was not until a hundred years later that people dared to come to the island to settle down.

Chorão, today, has a huge variety of attractions. What hits us first (after the positively striking beauty of the landscape) is the large stretches of mangroves reflected upon the clear waters of the Rivers Mapuca and the Mandovi. While the famous Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, the biggest of its kind in Goa, is located here, we were also told to expect a large variety of birds and animals as the motorised canoe putters along...

… for instance, as we floated alongside the darkly beckoning shadows of the mangroves, with the *shevtte* (State fish of Goa) popping up and down around us, the boatman pointed to a crocodile that immediately jumped off the bank with a huge splash and disappeared into the waters – scary, ***and*** disappointing! He also said that if we were lucky, we could spot a family of otters scurrying across the river or hiding among the drooping branches of the mysterious mangroves. But they did not oblige. And the wolves and foxes, the wild boar, jackals and porcupines, all said to be natives of the island, did not make an appearance either.

We were fortunate, however, to see the:

and several other species like the Pond Heron, Red Shank, Sandpiper, Yellow-beaked Egret, Bharadwaj (or Crow pheasant), cormorant, Black-headed ibis and the fruit bat.

And then we went on to soak in the picture-postcard beauty of the countryside – 16th century churches, and temples that predated the Portuguese. St. Bartholomew (in Ambelim village) was the first one we saw, sharing the fears and the fervour of the early Christians. The ruins of an old seminary were another source of deep reflective rumination. There was a “Devaki Krishna Temple” here, dedicated to the biological mother of the Lord Krishna, the deity of which was smuggled out to Mayem and then to Machel – a sad story in itself. Legend has it that they met on this island, but the better-known fact is that this is the only place in India, where both of them are worshipped together.

Chorão was known in the 16th-19th century, for its cheese: *Queijo da Ilha de Chorão* (Cheese of the Island of Chorão) has disappeared today, but the island has still a lot to say “Cheese!” about. 

With that smile still on our lips, we next plan to visit Usgalimal (a second time), near Rivona in Sanguem, for its pre-historic petroglyphs on the River Kushvati. It’s rock art which is said to be 20,000 to 30,000 years old showing animals and human figures – and as you sit on the rocks and imagine the paleolithic man with his crude instruments of art, what you need to handle most is the goose bumps.
