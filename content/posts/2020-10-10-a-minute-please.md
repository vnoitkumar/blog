***Spread all over this mountain plane;***

***A dainty yellow in Color,***

***With a black head as its center;***

***Gazing with joy at the sun,***

***Swallowing the rays with eagerness;***

***And shining in its exuberance,***

***Spreading its fragrance in all directions;***

***Nodding its head in appreciation,***

***At the gentle breeze passing by.***

***Alas! Wonâ€™t you spare a minute,***

***To pause, to gaze and to wonder,***

***At the spectacular nature spread before you;***

***To take in the beauty and color,***

***As they parade before you ,***

***Blooming in all their grandeur;***

***Only to vanish into the darkness at the end of the day,***

***And to re-appear with the sunrise next day,***

***To give you that joy all over again;***

***Only if you were to spare a minute,***

***To stand, to gaze to wonder and to share,***

***What they are ready to spare!!!***
