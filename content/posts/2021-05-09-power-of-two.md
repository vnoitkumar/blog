Having woken up early in the morning to complete the presentation which she was required
to make in the office that day, she just had a cup of coffee before rushing out. The drive
from Mysore Colony in Chembur in the North-eastern suburb of Mumbai to her office in
Nariman Point was a nightmare. Hopefully, once the expressway from Vashi to Wadala via
Chembur was completed the travel time would be reduced drastically, allowing her to spend
more time at home. Her husband, still in the bathroom, would, in his usual frustrated mood,
eat whatever the maid dished out and leave at a far less frenetic pace for his dispensary
near the Chembur Railway Station, by about 10. At about which time she would still be
working on the finer points of the presentation. A Deputy Chief Financial Controller in an
MNC and a Medico in private practice are not the best of combinations but then fate plays
its games now and then …
The presentation was followed by the expected level of gruelling questions – for which she
was prepared, mostly. What she wasn’t prepared for was the call from her son’s college.
She was just finishing the tiffin of idli-sambar she had ordered from the office canteen.
“Is this Mrs. Tiruchirapalli?”
“Um … who’s calling?” She just couldn’t explain it to these North-Indians. Her husband’s full
name was “Dr. Tiruchirapalli Parthasarathy Gopalan” – which meant that Dr. Gopalan was
the son of a certain Mr. Parthasarathy, and the family probably belonged to the town of
Tiruchirapalli in some ancient times. Her son, accordingly, was Tiruchirapalli Gopalan
Ramakrishna. At the most she could be addressed as Mrs. Gopalan or by her own name:
Mrs. Gopalan Meenakshi. “Mrs. Tiruchirapalli” was the limit!
“I am Dr. M.S. Gupta speaking. Principal of Maharashtra College of Engineering, Panvel,
where your son is studying. Uh, Mrs. Tiruchi- ”
“Er… Dr. Gupta, please. My name is Mrs. Meenakshi.”
“Oh, ok. Thank you, Mrs. Meenakshi. I was feeling a bit odd addressing you with the name
of the old temple-town. But since that is the common name between the father and son, I
thought that was your surname! Please forgive me!” Meenakshi could almost feel the stupid
embarrassed grin coming through his voice. “Mrs. Meenakshi, have you been checking your
son’s progress in the college these past few months?”
“Honestly, no, Dr. Gupta. I have been awfully busy with my job. I am due for a promotion any
time now, you know how it is.” There was not even a grunt of response from the other side.
“And,” she continued, “as you probably know, my husband is a private medical practitioner –
who also has odd hours of work. Ok, ok, I can understand that, for you, these are only
excuses. My Ramakrishna has always been a good student, Dr. Gupta, and I had safely
assumed that with you at the helm, he was in good hands.” (A little bit of flattery cannot do
any harm?)
“I appreciate the trust you have placed in us, Mrs. Tir…er…Meenakshi. But could you kindly
find time to meet me in my office tomorrow at 11:00? I would be happy if Mr. … er your
husband could also come with you.”

With a sense of foreboding, she found herself nodding into the telephone. For the next
umpteen minutes, she remained in stunned silence. She didn’t dare to think of what might
be happening to her son. Drugs? Alcohol? Was it women? Or bad friends? The assurance
with which she had gone ahead with her life after her son had gone to the college hostel
suddenly dissipated. Her mind was awhirl. The presentation she had made was already a
distant memory. The blurred image of a boy entered her cabin, took away the half-
consumed snack. “Should I talk to Gopalan?” was her first rational thought. He would be
busy with his patients. But then, this was serious enough to disturb him. With all the
indulgence he showed to his patients, she found that he was easily irritated with her calls;
but he will be positively furious if I wait till the evening.
“What’s the meeting about?” he asked. Meenakshi didn’t know. “You should have asked!” he
said irritably. “I can’t understand how you people work in the office! Can you attend a
meeting without any idea of the purpose?”
She let him rant on. “The Principal thought it important enough for both of us to meet him
tomorrow morning,” she replied as calmly as she could. “I thought it important enough to call
you and inform you so that you can reschedule your appointments or whatever it is you do,
for tomorrow.”
“‘Whatever it is you do’! This is really too much!” He cut off the connection. She could have
used better words ... and she kept on staring at her phone. No chance of any consolation
from there. She tried to get her son on his cell phone. She was informed, courtesy the
service provider, that “the person you are calling is not accepting any calls at the moment.”
She felt it was a very personalised message for her from her son: he didn’t want to accept
any calls from his mother at this crucial, anxious moment ... her eyes filled, and the resultant
blurring of vision was the least of her worries.
Mechanically, she pulled the keyboard of the PC towards her and started browsing through
her emails. Finding some odd stuff which should have gone to the spam folder and nothing
of interest there, she moved to her Facebook account. Her account had 115 ‘notifications’.
She idly clicked on the icon and was surprised to find several of them were from her
husband. With a half-amused smile she opened the latest one. Something in it reminded her
of what she had seen in the emails. She went back hurriedly, and that half smile dried up.
She stared at the email message on her computer, her mind racing so fast that the words
seemed to merge together, no longer making any sense. Just three lines, but enough to
make her life – the life she’d worked so hard and sacrificed so much to build – begin to
crumble around her. As one in a trance, she went through all his other letters ...

....................

She had hired a cab because her car would be recognised easily. She had to catch him by
surprise – and, possibly, reason with him. The patients’ waiting room was empty. She sat
down on one of the uncomfortable chairs, looked around at the dust, the old magazines and
wondered: is this how he manages his dispensary? The man whose bed was perfectly made
as soon as he woke up, whose shoes were never dusty, whose tie was always the precise

length...? What happens to him when he comes here? She walked into the consulting room
and found it even more derelict. What else did she expect after having read that email?

....................

She plodded back to her office. The cab just didn’t seem to move fast enough. Everything
that she had built and thought she had created ... was falling apart. And there wasn’t
anything she could do about it. Or was there? But which of the problems was greater: the
son or the husband? Of the son she knew nothing, of the husband, well ... even less. His
abandoned clinic and his emails … if this were an accounting problem, the auditor would
have pointed out… the ends don’t meet. You can take the assets and liabilities as they
come but you don’t get a chance to make a ‘trial balance’ in real life. Meenakshi was not
amused by these odd parameters of her professional life coming up at this juncture. Like
some cruel joke... Anyway, she couldn’t take any more today. She decided to go to the
office and inform her people that she would be taking the afternoon off.
When she reached her office, her husband was waiting for her.
“They told me that you had stepped out ... but I found your car. So ...”
“I came back for the car. Can we discuss this at home?” Meenakshi asked. Brusque.
“Where’s home, Meenakshi?” he asked quietly. It was ages since he had called her “Meenu”
but this question was more, much more hurtful. She couldn’t speak.
He saw that his words had hit her hard, perhaps harder than he had intended. Maybe if he
had raised this subject earlier, maybe a couple of years earlier, then perhaps he wouldn’t
have had to ask the question at all today. But he hadn’t ... and now when he did, he was
saddened at the effect it had on her. Nothing could be done now unless ... unless what?
Unless she apologises? Am I so far gone as the proverbial MCP? Unless she agrees to
cook my breakfast, everyday? Unless what? On the other hand, what is this life I am leading
at home? Where are we going as a family? What is happening to our son? If I have to
depend on the maid servant for everything, why don’t I marry her?
Meenakshi’s silence was also filled with raucous mental chatter. What is the problem here?
Am I at fault? Am I the only one at fault? I’m not a feminist, but do I get some freedom to
follow my career or not? He knew about my career when we were married. I have grown in
the profession over the years. He can’t say that I have not looked after him and our son over
the years ... and who supported him when he started out on his private practice? What if our
roles were reversed?
Where is home? What a loaded question that is! Everything depends on how I respond. Or
should I respond at all? He knows. He knows why he asked the question. He knows what he
is about to do.... he has planned this over a long time.
....................

When they reached home in their separate cars there was what could only be called
aggressive silence. She went and had a long shower, changed into her night wear and was
surprised to find that he had used the other bathroom to freshen himself up. Then she went
to the kitchen and got a cup of tea for each. She waited for him to start. She couldn’t be sure

but he seemed to have a look of sadness as he sipped the tea, as though he had longed for
the tea made by her – and she was overwhelmed with a sense of guilt. Guilt that she knew
wasn’t fair to herself. Guilt that arose from generations of female subservience. Guilt that
she felt for not being there for him all the time that the patriarchal society as much as her
feelings for him required of her. Guilt also arising out the love that wanted to do those things
for him but couldn’t due to the extremely demanding nature of her job.
“Ok,” he started. “You know now from my emails, that I have also taken up a job in a small
place called the Nigam hospital in Panvel so that I have fixed times of work. You also know
that I am planning to move out to a flat near Ramki’s hostel. I felt that one of us at least
should look after him. From there I can visit him often.”
“You have taken such a big decision. Didn’t you feel that we should have discussed this?”
“Yes. Certainly. I was planning to discuss it with you when you could give me the time. Until
then the only way of communicating with you was through the email. When even that failed
to get your attention – apparently you were too busy to see your personal emails. I was
hoping that somehow, some day, before it was too late, you would see my messages.”
“You could have stopped me from whatever I was doing ... and talked to me.” She wouldn’t
let the shake in her voice be too obvious.
“Maybe I could.” She couldn’t make out if he was being sarcastic, but she let it go. There
was a sadness about him when he said it and she felt the need to put her arm around him.
To give him a hug. She pulled her chair closer to him; his reaction almost put her off.
Though not an outright rejection, there was a clear indication of something long forgotten,
something unfamiliar. She pressed her arm down. He took time to relax.
She didn’t really know whether it was a kind of self-pity or sadness at the way things had
turned out but her eyes moistened for the second time that day. Was there a sense of the
primordial guilt again ... that led the tears to flow? One thing she knew was that she wasn’t
bringing them on … the usual feminine weapon against husbands. She wasn’t trying at all to
call attention to her own sense of loss. The loss was of the family, and good-feeling, the love
and togetherness that once prevailed among them. “Do you think,” she whispered, “we can
start over?”
He looked at her for a long time. He could neither shake nor nod his head. Either of the
responses was fraught with consequences he wasn’t ready to handle. “You could move in
with me in Panvel,” he said after what seemed to be a very long time. Her heart did a virtual
somersault. She grinned and gave him a tighter hug. He was surprised to see her reaction;
her thought was: He isn’t leaving me… he isn’t going away!
“We will meet the Principal tomorrow,” she said, happily, “whatever the problem is, we will
sort it out together.”
