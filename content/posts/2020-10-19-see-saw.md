I'm like a yoyo

I buckle down

Then I bounce back.

Its buoyancy

Of a sort.

However much

Your mind

Presses you down

You pop up

Like a

Jack in the box.

You smile

To yourself.

Your steps

Become light.

You even sing

Sometimes whistle.

But what goes up

Comes down

And yourself

You begin to shun.

Call it depression

Or what you will.

Plunges you in tears

Irrational fears.

It pulls you down

Down underground.

You cringe, cry

You want to die.

But oh, no, no

You won't let go.

You cling, you grasp,

Every straw you clasp.

You breathe,

You heave.

For what goes down

Comes up too,

And again

I'm filled with fun!
