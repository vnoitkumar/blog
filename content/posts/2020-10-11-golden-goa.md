**Golden Goa!**

Legend has it that Parshuram, the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, was compelled by certain circumstances (too long to relate here) to carve out a territory for himself. He stood at a vantage point on the Western Ghats, at a time when the Arabian Sea swirled around the foot of the hills, and shot an arrow into the Sea. The sea moved back! The stretch from where he stood to the point where the arrow landed, a beautiful patch of land was created, with swaying palms, golden sands and turquoise blue seas – that is GOA! The landing ground of that arrow is a village known as Banaulim today, which is a corruption (thanks to the Portuguese) of the words: Bana- halli, loosely translated as arrow-village.\

Today, all the rich culture that makes up this piece of the earth is sacrificed to the concept of beaches and bacchanalian excesses. When we think of Goa, it always brings on images of Portuguese domination …. Before we go further, it needs to be clarified that the “domination” was not at all like the British domination over the rest of the subcontinent. Goans were never “slaves” of the Portuguese. Rather, the option of Portuguese citizenship to those born in Goa before December 1961 is still available. No such option ever existed for British “subjects”.

Coming back to the abundance of culture and history, how many of us know that there is a thirty-thousand-year old, riverside site of petroglyphs in South Goa? It was discovered as recently as 1993 and its antiquity is a matter of debate among experts. While Wikipedia places it at 30,000 years, some say that it belongs to the Mesolithic period (which would place it around 8500 to 6000 BCE), others place it at about 2500 BCE. The last one would bring it to the time of the Harappan civilisation, and therefore, is not acceptable. We couldn’t have had “stone-age” coexisting with that highly advance civilisation! The petroglyphs, which are basically, etchings on the rock base of the River Kushwati, are comprised of various animal figures and one that has been identified as a mother – in the act of giving birth. If it is, it’s a rather obscure imagery!

One of the earliest references to Goa in ancient history dates back to the 3rd century BCE. Goa (known as Govapattinam or Aparanta/ Sunaparanta) was a part of the Mauryan kingdom under Ashoka, and later it was ruled by the Chalukyas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and others. It became a major maritime power during the rule of the Kadambas in the 10th century up to the 13th century. Their capital was in a town called Chandrapur (which was changed by the Portuguese to Chandor). The Delhi Sultanate was the cause of some turbulence but stability was regained during the rule of Vijayanagar kingdom that lasted for a century.\

Then, in 1498, Vasco da Gama is credited with having “discovered” the route to India, via the Cape of Good Hope. He landed up in Cochin (Kochi). But while giving him the credit, we forget that the west coast of India had a flourishing trade with the regions of the Persian Gulf and parts of the east coast of Africa; we forget also that the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean were infested with pirates. It is, therefore interesting to know that Vasco da Gama was assisted, guided and protected on the route from the Cape to Kochi, by a fleet of Indian merchant ships following the dictates of the monsoon winds. But for this guidance and protection, the Portuguese would not have ventured this far – and therefore, neither would the British or the Dutch, or the French! Vasco da Gama, it may be noted, was in Kochi only about a year before Columbus discovered the western route to India!!

Ten years later, and after a victory of sorts with the zamorin of Kochi, Alfonso de Albuquerque came up the River Madovi, in Goa. For centuries before this, the estuary of the Mandovi was a major trade centre, and Albuquerque knew that by taking over Goa he would be capturing the best harbour on the coast. Arabian thoroughbreds would be brought here for transportation to the hinterland. Guides in Hampi still inform you that horses for the huge market in the town came in from Goa.

When Albuquerque entered, he had Adil Shah (of the Sultanate of Bijapur) to deal with. His first attack was unsuccessful. He camped on one of the five islands (anjadiva) off the Konkan coast. Adil Shah could have attacked him and his depleted forces but for some reason he did not.

Three months later, with reinforcements from Portugal, he attacked Goa when Adil Shah and a majority of his forces were busy containing the Marathas – he was informed about Goa’s vulnerable position by Thimayya (a sort of mercenary in the service of the Vijayanagar kingdom). This was in 1510.

450 years later, the Indian armed forces invaded Goa at a time when a majority of the Portuguese forces were sent out to quell a rebellion in Angola.
