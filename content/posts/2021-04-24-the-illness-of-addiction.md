If there is one illness that can take a toll on all aspects of the human being it is the illness of addiction. The easiest form of addiction to identify is the addiction to drugs and alcohol which is visible, compared to other addictive behaviour patterns which are often not categorized as being a problem – and therefore not easily recognized as such.

For instance, people may be prone to blowing their trumpets; live to eat: rather than eat to live; some may have a great fascination for sexual activity; fervent sanctimonious religious attendance: combined with hate of neighbours, but all these are “ok” (not being socially unacceptable) even though damaging to mind and body, and to the eternal spirit which is the medium of amalgamation between the other two. To live a life of sobriety, of course, doesn't allow any of the above, besides complete abstinence from all drugs including alcohol and nicotine which are socially accepted to some degree. Addicts are cautioned about overeating and gambling which have been seen as a trigger to return to active addiction all over again. Balance is the code to stay sober in this new lifestyle of chemical freedom.

But when it comes to the conspicuous consumption of alcohol and other mood-changing, mind-altering chemicals every single aspect thereof is visible, and the recluse (for that is what the addict becomes) is targeted with "Why can't they do it decently and in moderation?", "Why have they to disgrace the good family they come from?", "We have to be so grateful that we don't have such rut in our family!", "He was so nice, what happened?", and a thousand other questions that have no answers.

The great psychologist, Carl Gustav Jung, once wrote that the answer to this riddle was in spiritus contra spiritum; Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (121-180 AD) also mentioned that Espiritum vinci Espiritus: which translates into “The Holy Spirit overcomes spirit”; That only the Holy Spirit can replace this High spirit of slumber with a profound spiritual awakening, is the only fact that can help in the arrest of addiction.

I have been there, trod that mill. I could, perhaps with some authority, say: Once an addict, always an addict. But that would not be the entire truth. That would also be a strong discouragement to anyone who wishes to get out of that rut. We need, however, to recognise it, and accept it in our mind, that it is an illness. An illness that may not have a cure … but, certainly, with help from above and from those around us, (and believe me, there’s help that is sometimes waiting for your call for help) it can be arrested.

As you grow from day to day, avoiding the addiction (it is now, so euphemistically, called “use of substances”), each day is a reprieve of sorts. And you grow stronger in spirit on a day-to-day basis. I have, in excess of thirty years, not touched any alcohol, heroin, sleeping pills, and nicotine. But I don’t dwell on that today. I believe that if you keep one eye on the past and the other on the future, today you will be cockeyed! What is done is done – both my addiction and my salvation. Nothing of my past allows me the luxury of strutting like a peacock or adding feathers to my cap. I am grateful today, that the Almighty handed back my life to me over thirty years ago … and that I could leave it in His mighty hands to keep me sober and happy.

Another important realisation for me is that the Illness of addiction can strike anyone. No one plans to become a Chemically Dependent Person. But when it does strike you (regardless of whether it started with youthful experimentation or via pathological depression) it takes over with a vice-like grip for reasons I will elaborate on later in # 3. One is not responsible for the illness but one is responsible to ensure that one gets well, and soon. This responsibility is often the subject of procrastination, along with defiance against those who care and the denial that one has a problem.

*To treat the illness,*

I have noted three areas that are needed to be understood to treat the ailment which is, 1. The Mental Obsession, 2. The Physical Craving, and 3. The Spiritual Bankruptcy.

1. “Mental obsession” urges you to have just one drink, fix, snort, etc. to feel good, be social, more comical, dance better, speak with courage, and to be socially acceptable. This is an area of very low self-esteem or severe depression.

2. For an addict who has already crossed the line of intelligence vs insanity (the line which separates being very thin), the physical craving takes over (when more than the spirit, it is the body that demands the alcohol or drug - and what is finally left is utter madness.

3. Why does this happen? It is because of a Spiritual Bankruptcy where the person concerned lives in a world with a population of one and indulgences in the self-centred attitude of thinking that they are the centre of the universe. This is the selfishness of a high order – but selfishness that is the core of the illness. Sharing and caring are absent, along with living a lie in the hope that it might become a truth.

If all the aspects of this illness have to be touched, which include the mental, physical, emotional, psychological, financial, spiritual, and social aspects, the world will not be able to contain the books which will have to be written, as it is said about the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of Saint John; but, in terms of Jung and several other psychologists, a cure from this illness cannot be merely physical or psychological: it needs to be a deep spiritual experience (an addict’s craving for alcohol was “the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for wholeness, expressed in medieval language: the union with God.” And, for my feeling of wholeness, my miracle, I cannot describe my gratitude in words.

This is a brief exercise of leaving footprints in the sands of time, with Longfellow’s hope, “that perhaps another/sailing o’er life’s solemn main/A forlorn and shipwrecked brother/ Seeing, shall take heart again. But there is one aspect of addiction that I need to touch upon before I conclude. Every addict has a “family”, a support system. And there is something weird about this support system for therein lies a strange danger. The fact that it affects family members in several ways, is doubtless. The loved ones adjust their lives and break their hearts, and their heads, to see that the affected person "gives up the bad habit". And finally, that does happen!

*What then?*

Do they feel empty? At a loose end, as if it were? Will they too have the “withdrawal” syndrome as acutely as the addict-now-reformed? And, worst of all, having established a long pattern of caring beyond the bounds of love, and hoping beyond hope – having had a definite purpose of sorts in their lives are now bereft of any kind of purpose. Finding another purpose, another daily routine that does not include the pathos of the addict and the looking after … is a difficult task. There has been nothing else in their lives but to give that care, live in that hope; that entire lifestyle of concern and help, feeling useful in some way or the other … is gone. Will they love the cured one with the same devotion as they did the addict? Are they ready for a profound personality change, a more difficult change, and to is taken more consciously than their earlier involuntary, crisis-driven decision to turn care-giver? Or, will they secretly wish for that life again?
