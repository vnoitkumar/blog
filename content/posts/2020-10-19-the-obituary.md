When I first saw the obituary in the papers, I thought it was simply another of Ejji’s pranks. Just a few weeks before I had seen pictures of him organizing a car rally somewhere outside India and later serving up some of his extraordinary cuisine.

When a few hours later, I learned that it was no prank, that Ejji’s ‘party’ here was truly over and he had moved the celebrations elsewhere, I was truly dismayed. We had exchanged notes on Facebook recently and his passing away was totally unexpected. But then I realized that mourning Ejji was the last thing he would have wanted. He wanted us to celebrate this too as we marvelled at and celebrated his life.

In my comment on his obituary therefore, I borrowed a quote from Shakespeare’s Macbeth, from the scene where Macduff describes how he had slain Macbeth who died a valiant warrior’s death with the challenge,

“Then lay on Macduff, and damned be him that first cries enough.”

Macduff reports,

“Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it. He died as one that had studied in death, to throw away the dearest thing he owed (owned) as (if) it were a careless trifle.”

With all respect to the great master I changed one word, the first one and wrote thus, as my celebratory message to his immediate family:

*“Everything in his life became him like the leaving it. He died as one that had studied in death, to throw away the dearest thing he owed as it were a careless trifle.”*

*Ejji lived and died on his own terms. I'm sure he is laying down terms for his innings in the next world too! Will miss you Ejji. And more particularly your 'Arsehole of the Day' – a truly Ejji-like, totally irreverent take on the moral and political absurdities that we experience in this so called Aatamanirbhar Bharath.! " I mean every word. . . .”*

In my 68 years of rather unconventional living across the seminary, the army, the corporates, and over 50 years in theatre, I have never come across anyone who truly deserved this epitaph other than Ejji. As he has claimed in his obituary, he truly and consistently lived life on his own terms.

I first met Ejji when working together on the international premier of Girish Karnad’s play, “The Dreams of Tipu Sultan” around 1998-99. Directed by Yamuna Naso, it involved a huge cast including foreigners playing the role of the British oppressors, and several prominent local actors. It was a big-budget production by The Madras Players, India’s oldest active English Theatre group. Ejji would come for rehearsals in different antique cars and occasionally host us at his house for wild parties. His house was like a Tanjore palace with beautiful artwork, intriguing photographs, an amazing bar with the most exotic of drinks, at the same time, all very tastefully done. For snacks you could have your pick of the regular chips and tikkas, and for the more adventurous there was wild elephant meat imported from Africa, and fried termites. There were no borderlines for experiencing, with Ejji. You decided how far you wanted to go and Ejji had already been there, done that, and waited ready to welcome you to the new adventure.

One of the incidents that endeared him to me happened when he was called to do a small role in a film directed by one of India’s most renowned and sought after directors, with whom I had also done some work a few months before. The shoot was to be at 2 in the afternoon, and Ejji was there right on time. Punctuality was part of his protocol. But the unit was not ready. They were still working on the earlier shot. By 3 or so, Ejji got annoyed. He told the Asst Director that he would leave if his scene was not started in the next few minutes. The AD was taken aback, as when stars are on the set nobody really bothered about the time of those doing bit roles. However, he communicated this to the Director. The AD returned to Ejji and magnanimously offered to let him use the air-conditioned caravan,

“ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ (top star) was using it for a couple of hours when the shoot got delayed. he was reading a book. would you like a magazine or something?”

This put Ejji completely off.

“You are no one to tell me where to sit or what to do with my time. I couldn’t care a f@#+k what \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ did. I could be sitting at home (and this is what I enjoyed most) shaving my cat, instead of hanging around here doing nothing. If it does not start immediately, I’m leaving.”

The now thoroughly shaken AD ran back to the Director and the shoot started within a few minutes.

After the shoot was over, the Director and the AD came over to Ejji and apologized profusely, promising never to call him for a shoot again.

The thought of Ejji sitting at home and shaving his cat kept me bursting out laughing at the most unexpected times over many weeks.

Another fascinating element of Ejji’s life was his total irreverence for the pseudo reverent. He had a feature titled, “Arsehole of the Day” where he would honour pseudo academic idiots and rogue politicians who said the most stupid and absurd things publicly. This included religious fanatics, political criminals, hardcore right wing academicians and many others who soon became laughing stocks across the world. Whenever I came across one of those eligible candidates, I would post them to Ejji, saying, “Here’s another one for your collection,” and some of them would appear on his esteemed page. Just a few days ago I posted him one more but by then Ejji had moved his party elsewhere.

He was everything he has claimed in the obituary, and more. What fascinates me is the humour that never left him even as he entered into a 10-hour high-risk surgery with the clear understanding that he may not come out of it in this dimension.

It does not matter. He was very particular that the party here must also go on, even as he paints the next dimension red in his own inimitable style.

Keep the party going, Ejji. You will not be forgotten. You will always be celebrated!
