She endured her first heartache

And moved on like a breeze

Never giving up hope on love

She sailed the seamless sea

Knowing the uncertainty it may behold

Flipped over by a giant wave

Yet with grace she surfed the tide

Tired and weary, for a while she rests

Only to be greeted by a fuzzy feel

She opens her eyes to a light of hope

With a bright smile he made her day,

So truly ecstatic was his love for her

Embarking on yet another adventure

She set her sail to his charming gaze

And saw the horizon in his bewitching eyes

She stayed strong through high and low

Fought the odds for a world so new

Where time ceased and seemed surreal

The magic soon began to fade

A perfect storm was here to disrupt

And also to teach her to evolve

She was lost again in the vast ocean

With no direction of the sun or moon

In the dark sky, she saw a shining star

Lighting within her the spark she was

She had found her path and her purpose

Followed the journey of her heart

For it did, does and will always know the way
