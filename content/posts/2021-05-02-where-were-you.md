You lie there now all shrivelled and shrunk!

It’s painful to see but I’m too drunk

With hate and spite;

Though I know it’s not right,

I want to so hurt you … but again did I flunk.

I have failed in your eyes in myriad ways;

I have strayed from your path, your persistent says;

But I’m happy today

For deciding to stray

From those bigoted views I could never embrace.

There you lie now, abandoned, forlorn,

I am not shocked nor with sympathy torn.

Your favourites have done this.

And, as God is my witness,

I knew this would happen. ‘Tis a story outworn:

Those whom you pour out your heart full of love to

Rarely, if ever, in your need will they rush to

Support you and help you

And guide you or hold you.

‘Tis the abandoned old stray that you surely will turn to.

When ***I*** needed you, I couldn’t ever find you.

I groped in the dark for a rock I could cling to.

You saw me and heard me,

Knew my need, ignored me

You had all your favourites you were giving your life to.

‘Twas never your gold or material possessions

All that I sought was your loving attention

I longed for your love

Not all, just a part of

That wealth that you showered on them, *that* affection.

Just a comforting word was all that I wanted;

A gesture to tell me that I’m not unwanted.

In vain did I try,

Stifled many a cry,

But you sent out dark arrows of silence instead

And now there you lie alone and heart-broken

And as I look at you, my heart still doth burn

But what is the use

Of this anger obtuse?

She’s beyond understanding, or loving concern.

Ironic, disgusting, macabre, this humour

How fate does play games with us, times without number

When ‘tis revenge we bring

To the monster, the sting

Is lost! No words nor barbs can disturb her.
