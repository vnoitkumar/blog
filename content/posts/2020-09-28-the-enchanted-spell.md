She yet again had cast her spell\
Only this time from the beyond\
It was like the magic of an alternate universe\
She had come out from hiding behind her elegant veil\
Surrounded with stars as her companions\
The twinkling light from a star afar\
As if eager to convey a significant message\
The flickering lights in the distant sky playing hide and seek\
The pale pink horizon forming an illusion for those who wished to drown in her beauty\
Close knit clouds appearing like a sponge offering comfort to those who fell for her enchantment\
Her light reflecting off the aircraft's turbine\
Giving it a silvery glow of precious ingot\
That night she was on a quest to add beauty to anything that came her way\
And in charge of creating something extraordinary out of the ordinary.
