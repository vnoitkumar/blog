description: I thought Iâ€™ll share a painting I did a couple of years back. The
  raising sun represents hope, enlightenment and knowledge. The receding mist in
  the foreground is ignorance. The abandoned old boat represents abandoning
  dreary dead habits. I leave the rest to your imagination - Sudhakar
