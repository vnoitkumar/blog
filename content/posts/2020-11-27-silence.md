in the silence of the mind

i heard the ragas of the soul

reverberating with the pulsation

of playful ecstasy,

as the primordial aham

glowing, within one infinitesimal speck

of potentiality

burst both in cosmic laughter

that still resounds

in the echoes of expanding space

and time.

somewhere along the way

a tiny fragment of consciousness

took on form

for a brief second to glow

and then fade away

like a galactic firefly.

trapped in that illusion

i lived and died a million times

in myriad forms till

i landed as a faceless fly

at the lotus feet of an enlightened one.

and i saw

that i was neither fly nor form

nor face nor mind nor space nor time -

no, none of these

i was the source, the infinitesimal speck

from where the laughter arose

before the beginning of time.
