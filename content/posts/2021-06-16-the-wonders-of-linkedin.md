**The wonders of LinkedIn:**

*I don't feel all boxed-in*

*With “viewers” from all o'er the world.*

*I write and I publish*

*Good stuff or just rubbish*

*This d'sire to be read is absurd!*

*More absurd, would you know,*

*Is my search high and low*

*If SHE has but glanced at my work*

*Wide-eyed or just bleary*

*From old Kalahari.*

*I'm disturbed, depressed and berserk*

*Till I see her "location"*

*That’s ‘nough approbation!*

*I reach for my papers anew.*

*"There's more!" I could tell her*

*And say that I need her*

*To read… to my spirit renew…*
