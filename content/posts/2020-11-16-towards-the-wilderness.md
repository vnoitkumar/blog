I walked away from the chaos

The routine and the madness

The screen that burns through your eyes

And the cell phones ringing never to cease

The million chores that get done a day

Though seldom noticed and cast away

A sense of disenchantment

Achingly hard to describe

Caught in a tedious web that is the bane of the human tribe

I walked and walked with a hurried step

The sounds receded and I felt my spirit pep

There appeared around me rustling leaves

And creepers weaving delicate hues atop the cottage eaves

I walked on and on and felt the wind dance in my hair

Never had I felt this joy of breaking away from the snare

I walked onwards with a nameless haste

In pursuit of the dream I chased

A place where there reigned serenity

That would grant me a glimpse of my lost sanity

Ah the wilderness opened its gates of resplendency

I caught my breath, and was swept by a wave of ecstasy

Not a soul for miles around

A green carpet caressing the ground

The patches of a beautiful blue sky

Peeping through the branches high

The wildflowers laughed in the sunlight bright

And the waterfall jumped up and down with childlike delight

Indulgently smiled the wise old trees at their pranks

While the squirrel looked askance sitting on its shanks

I drank in the beauty around me, though weary

Troubled not by the silence so eerie

It dawned on me that amidst the crowd was disquietude

While in this wilderness was just I, content in my solitude
