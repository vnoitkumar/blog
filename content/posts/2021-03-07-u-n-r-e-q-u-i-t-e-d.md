I sit upon a craggy rock

And watch the gentle tide

I hear a lonely seagull squawk

As if my heart had cried

Oh, from this little islet of mine

I see her amidst the crowd

I’d tell her: Love, this heart is thine

But ne’er could I say it out loud

I write the words upon the shore

The millionth time, for sure.

Will the frolicking rollicking waters make sure

Of taking my message to her
