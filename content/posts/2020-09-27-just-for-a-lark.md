I took one last look at myself in the small mirror on the wall, slicked my hair and smiled. My hand automatically reached out for the Cuticura powder on the shelf but I withdrew it just in time. “Only village baays use talcum powder on their faces,” I admonished myself. “City guys use after-shave and deo, mind – it,” I said trying an impersonation of Dilip’s ‘mind-it’ which he executed in perfect Rajnikanth i-shytle.

I was very excited. I was going out for a movie and then to Barista with the gang. “The Gang” felt so good to hear. I had always wanted to belong to a gang but was too self-conscious and inhibited even to make friends with these suave, smart, self –confident, English-speaking students of my college. And I? I was the proverbial village bumpkin when I arrived in college on that first day – my dress, my hairstyle, my way of talking, my English accent – the perfect target for ragging, and boy, did I get ragged! I had been prepared for it and didn’t allow myself to get overly upset but it was tough-going for almost one month. Finally it was Dilip who took me under his wing and the ragging slowly stopped.

Dilip was a happy-go-lucky guy who grabbed whatever life had to offer with both hands. He was athletic, played foot-ball with a passion, followed cricket like a true Indian and somehow waded through his studies. He was ready to try out anything, got into a lot of scrapes but knew where to draw the line. He never felt embarrassed to say, “Sorry boss, this is not my cup of tea.” He was very warm-hearted and tended to take everyone into his fold which led to his becoming my friend. He said that he had admired my guts for having taken the ragging for so long. In a few months he turned me into a smart City slicker too!

City dwellers only notice our outward lack of polish but we rural guys come from pretty solid stock. Facing hardship is a very common aspect of our lives. Take my father – he was the Contract Carpenter in a construction firm in a town close to our village. He had come up through sheer dint of hard work and had a comfortable job, a comfortable home, a loving wife and a grown son. But the moment he realized that the local college was not good enough for his only son to achieve his ambition, he just wound up his family, quit his secure life and shifted to the City. It was a huge sacrifice to make but he never thought of it that way. He worked hard and re-established himself in the City. I am proud to be my father’s son. After my graduation I want to join the Indian Institute Of Science in Bangalore and then move abroad for higher research. Nothing will deter me from achieving my goal.

It’s very amusing the way I joined ‘the gang’. Taking ‘selfies’ is such a fad these days. I was talking to Dilip in the canteen one afternoon when a group of boisterous students were taking a ‘selfie.’ “Dilip, come,” one of them yelled and Dilip dragged me there. I’m sure Dilip was pulling my leg, but he insisted that one of the girls’ said, “Hey, Who’s that handsome guy with an electric smile?” I must confess that inwardly I was thrilled. Electric Smile? Me? Holy Cow! ‘LectricShmi-i-le!! I met them in the canteen one afternoon. What fun, what chatter, what laughter. I’d never experienced something like this before. Dilip and Raghav were like clowns, up to antics that kept us in splits all the time. Latha and Radhika had been close buddies since school. Total opposites – Radhika was down-to-earth, good, prudent, kind, a friend in need and Latha? Latha was ------ was ------‘Lectric (like my Shmi-i-le?!). She was totally without inhibition or guile, out to have a great time and game for any sort of wager. They were a happy gang who hung out together at the college canteen, bunked classes to go for movies, got into scrapes mostly instigated by Latha and in general had a blast.

At first I was hesitant to join them because I belonged to a different class altogether but Dilip convinced me that it was of no consequence. “Even I treat only occasionally and only in the canteen,” he said. Latha was very affluent. She was the daughter of a big industrialist but she never threw her weight around or her money. I hit upon the idea of doing a few tuitions to earn some pocket money and finally I was one of them. I was floating in a seventh heaven.

Laying wagers had turned into our favourite pass-time. We would dare one of the girls to go and maintain a three minute conversation with one of the senior boys. They would dare us to go down on our knees and present a red rose to a particularly haughty senior. Dilip got smacked in the face for doing that, once. How we all laughed! Raghav dared Latha to go with me to my house and meet my parents. Raghav should have known better than to do that. Latha happily walked down the narrow lane in which I lived and met my mother. She enjoyed a tiffin of ‘*kuzhipaniyaram* and *chutney’* and left, promising to return as often as possible, which she did. On her fourth visit she burst out laughing at the look of total discomfiture on my mother’s face, hugged and kissed her saying, “Now you explain everything to her,” and left. It took a while to convince my mother that this was the City, that this was how city girls were – free and friendly.

Latha’s father bought her a car for her eighteenth birthday and insisted that she drive herself to college. Latha was over- joyed as a car meant more freedom and more fun. We jumped into a totally different level of freedom. We could go wherever we wanted at whatever time took our fancy. We met up in the evenings and went to the beach. We played Frisbee. We also parked our car in the corner of a lonely street in the dark and tried our hand at smoking cigarettes. Radhika would join us for all the fun but she never touched a cigarette. We started boozing occasionally. Radhika opted out of these outings. We ragged her mercilessly but she just didn’t waver from her stand. I admired her for it but I didn’t think there was any harm in what we did. Everyone did these things even in the villages.

One day Latha brought us some new foreign cigarettes which her brother had given her. The moment we inhaled, we knew that it was not an ordinary cigarette but we smoked them anyway. It did strange things to us. That night appa was angry with me.

“I don’t like this one bit,” he yelled. “You’re out late more and more often and now you come home in this state.”

I think it was the effect of that cigarette that made me react the way I did. I shouted back at him.

“What’s bugging you? I’m getting good marks, aren’t I? You don’t like me to have a little fun. What do you know about the city? Villagers!”

My mother gave me a tight rap across my face. “Don’t you dare talk to appa like that,” she said. “After all the sacrifice that he has done for you!”

“Big sacrifice,” I spat out. “I can earn the money in one year and throw it on his face.”

“Get out of this house at once,” my mother said, seething with anger.

“Parvathi, calm down,” my father consoled her, “He is not in his senses. Let him sleep it off.”

The next morning I was very ashamed of myself. Dilip told us that the cigarette had marijuana and that if we were going in that direction he would opt out. None of us wanted to get into that racket. It was addictive. We just wanted to have some great fun and be happy.

Anything can become addictive – even harmless habits like placing wagers. We all saw ‘3 Idiots’ together. That was it! After that we would take turns entering people’s houses in the middle of the night, ringing their door-bell and making a dash for the gate. We would then get into the car and drive away feeling exhilarated. Latha would insist on having her turn.

One evening when we were on the beach, Raghav and Dilip dared us to pick someone’s pocket. Latha and I worked out a plan. I followed the prospective target closely and Latha followed a few feet behind. Within minutes I had withdrawn his wallet, removed a few notes, dropped the wallet with a thud and carried on past the man. Latha called out, “Sir, Sir, your wallet,” picked up the wallet and handed it to the man with a smile. At that precise moment Dilip drove up honking. Latha waved and got into the car and they drove away. They picked me up at the corner of the street.

“How did you manage that so effectively,” they asked.

“Rural acumen,” I said, grinning. How they ribbed me! I felt very pleased with myself. It never occurred to us that from a group of boisterous students we had turned into rowdy elements. Prudence had made its exit with Radhika.

Latha gifted me a lovely smart phone for my birthday. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was the most precious gift I had ever received in my life. I went home and showed it to appa and he said, “Return it at once. We don’t accept such expensive gifts from unknown people.”

I was horrified. “Unknown? Appa, she’s one of my best friends,” I said. “She has given me a gift to show she cares for me.”

Appa was not convinced. “That’s not the point at all. You are losing your sense of values. Give it back, please. I’ll buy you a cell phone if you want.”

“What can you get me,” I asked sarcastically. “Some cheap two-k cell phone. Do you have any idea how much this phone costs? Fifteen-k, no less. I’m not giving it back and that’s final. Latha will be upset if I do.”

“You’re getting carried away with the glitz and glamour of city life. I wish we had never left the village,” appa said sadly.

“Well! You can always go back if you want,” I said in an off –hand manner. “I can manage, you know.”

I don’t know how it came about but I found myself bragging that I could evacuate the whole college if I wanted. “Done,” said Latha “By a specific time. I bet you five-k if you win. If you lose you have to treat me to four movies in one month.” The bet was sealed.

D-day arrived. The others were to remain in their classes. My time-out was 12 noon. As usual I had a plan. The Public Address System was in the Principal’s office. There was a staff room across the corridor from his office. I had already noted that no staff member occupied the room in that period on that particular day. The Principal came in around 11:30 every morning and went straight to his office. I hid in the staff room peeping out at his door. If any staff member entered, I could always pretend that I had been sent by a lecturer to collect a stack of books. I waited for the principal to come. 11:30 -----11:40 – I looked at my watch. 11:45 – I started getting anxious. There wasn’t much time left. Aah – there he was! I observed him carefully as he walked to the door. I knew that time was running out but suppressed the urge to check my watch. I took a deep breath and started counting in reverse under my breath. “ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five ------.” “THERE’S A BOMB IN THE STAFF ROOM,” I yelled at the top of my voice and scooted down the corridor and out of the building at super speed. Within minutes the voice came out on the Public Address System – “Will all the students calmly evacuate their class-rooms. This is a Bomb Scare Exercise. Follow the rules practised – Down the stairs in rows of two. No need to panic. No running. We want everyone outside within five minutes. Go to the football and cricket grounds and stay there till further notice.”

The students were very happy – anything to miss class. They filed out of their classes and onto the grounds where they got together in groups and chatted. I had unobtrusively joined one line as they left the building. Then I went in search of my friends feeling super elated. Ya! I had done it! It was exactly 12 noon.

Police vehicles came screeching into the campus followed by the bomb squad who jumped out of the vehicle in their gear and went into the building. The students watched aghast. It was a real bomb scare! I winked at Dilip. “Bloody fool,” he said under his breath, “What have you gone and done?” At that precise moment a hand came up from behind, grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and dragged me towards a police vehicle. It was the Pricipal’s peon. He pushed me towards the Inspector and said, “This is the boy. I saw him with my own two eyes.” Two hulky policemen lifted me bodily, threw me into the police vehicle, jumped in after me and the vehicle drove away. “Bomb scare, is it,” one of the policemen said giving me a tight slap across my face. I felt as if my neck would break. I remembered the slap that my mother had dealt me a few months ago.

Here I am sitting alone on a bench in the police station holding my head in my hands. I feel deep remorse – as usual too late. Appa had been right. I had allowed myself to get carried away. I had turned into a total rowdy. Pick pocketing? How despicable! How did I think it was a fun thing to do?

I feel as if I have been here for ever. I am scared. To be honest, I am terrified. What is going to happen to me? Will they put me in jail? And what about the others? Will they come and support me or Are they just Fair Weather Friends?

THE END
