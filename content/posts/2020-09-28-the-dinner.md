she was very fond of fishing

this girl that i loved

so, one day

i bought a couple of fishing rods

hired a boat

and took her fishing in the lake.

it was a beautiful day

and i was so moved

by the water, and the sky

and the distant shore, that

plucking out my heart

i gave it to her.

she took it

smiled

said “thanks”, and then

dropped it into the tin

containing the bait.

when the worms were all finished

and no fish had been caught

she stuck my heart to her hook

and threw the line saying,

“this is better bait

than worms.”

and sure enough

she caught a great big fish.

we returned.

she cooked the fish

and invited me to dinner.

i went, but strangely enough

I didn’t have

the heart to dine with her.
