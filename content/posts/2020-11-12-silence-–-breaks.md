He was the office clown. Always drawing laughter out of serious situations. He used to be good at his work. They say. Earlier. Now he felt the need to entertain people with his gimmicks. To make people laugh at themselves, at himself, at times. There was a plan to put him away. Though no one had the heart to do it. Besides the fact that his height of six feet plus and his well-built body were a deterrent on their own. His eyes were light grey which at times seemed to penetrate your skull – leave alone any dress that you would be wearing. Without those pranks, he could have been quite a heartthrob. Her heartthrob. But here he was standing near the wall, on the corridor, his right hand cupped about his ear, eavesdropping on something apparently happening on the other side. As she came closer to him, he seemed to give up his attempts, slapped a frustrated palm on his forehead. And walked away from the wall. She passed by, on her way to the boss’ office, studiedly ignoring him, dismissing him in one fluid thought: he is up to one of his usual pranks.

On her way back, she found that he was at the wall again. She was curious but didn’t show it openly. Kept her eyes glued to the chequerboard tiles on the corridor. Least of all, to him. No point in encouraging him, she decided, firmly. She walked down to her cubicle, slid into her chair, and went on with her work. Sometime later, she needed to use the washroom. She peeped out into the corridor. He was there, his ear pressed against the wall this time, straining himself to catch a whisper, a murmur, a whimper from the other side … or was it inside … of the wall?

It is only an internal wall of the building, she thought to herself, a partition wall, as the civil engineers might call it. Nor is It a load-bearing wall which could be in danger of crumbling…revealing secrets that one may not be able to handle. But then, is that something that can be “heard” like this? By a naked ear, as it were? What could the idiot be trying? He had nothing to do with the maintenance of the structure anyway. He had nothing to do. He was obviously trying to listen in on someone’s conversation.

But… on the other side of the wall was the old record room. She knew that. He knew that. He also knew that she knew that. It was filled with files and dust and rats – and giant cockroaches. She went on to the washroom and returned to see him standing away from the wall now. He was gazing at it, fixedly, from a distance of about 2 feet; his face a large question. An accusation. As if the wall was expected to deliver its share of information to him and was holding it back. Maliciously.

He glanced at her briefly and turned back to his acute attention on a spot on the wall, on a level with his eyes.

“You don’t have any work to do?” She asked him, more gently than she had intended. His head, his eyes a monsoon grey now, the pinched nose, oscillated diagonally between her face 5 feet high and the spot on the wall almost a foot higher, thrice. Or was it four times? It was as if he couldn’t see her any more than he could hear what the wall had to say.

That was scary, and intriguing, at the same time. The joker that he usually was, his behaviour today was odd. She went back to her cubicle. Opened up her file but her mind was out there with that chap at the wall. Maybe they ought to put him away. Soon.

Concentration was impossible. She struggled to compose a single meaningful sentence. At the lunch break, she decided to see if the nut was still there. He wasn’t.

So, surreptitiously, looking up and down the deserted corridor (all were busy tackling their lunch packs), she tip-toed to the wall. She placed her ear against it. First the left. Then, turning around, the right. Pushed it flat against the wall. She strained to hear something, anything, but there was only silence. She could feel the pressure on her ear as it strained against the unyielding bricks … unyielding, not giving way; not giving away. And just as she was about to give up, she realised that the clown was standing beside her. Watching her. A slight shiver ran through her. And embarrassment made her dark skin turn violet. 

“Seriously?”

Molecules of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. She straightened herself up, adjusted her sari back into the formidable armour it is supposed to be. And was walking away. Awkwardly.

“You’re giving up, Madam?”

She turned around slowly and looked at him. Squarely. Curiously. Confused. Waiting for him to go on.

“Madam! I have been trying to get something out of the wall for the last 5 hours …and you expect it to talk to you in 5 minutes?” A half-smile hovered over his lips, his eyes. A strange, spine-chilling kinship in that smile.

She was silent. There was the image dancing before her eyes, of her colleagues in various forms of suppressed laughter, when they’d hear that she had fallen prey to his latest prank.

But what the …!

There he was, pressing his ear to the wall again.

She knew for certain that he couldn’t, he wouldn’t, hear anything. Isn’t that what a wall is expected to do? Keep things out? Hold things in??

But what was that strange humming that *she* had heard? A sound that seemed to come from the bowels of the earth. Of magma churning and a distant grunt as if the hot lava plopped; a silent wail as it escaped through clenched teeth. Sounds she’d been hearing from her pillow when she had a fever. As a child. At times even without the fever. That, and the pounding like the drums on Roman galley ships. Sometimes apace with her heartbeat. Sometimes at double the speed. Always ending in that nearly inaudible wail. A sigh. Then silence, Forgotten, all these years. They had remained in the wall. On the other side of the wall. In the wall. In her head. Since her parents died. Since before her parents died. Memories aroused now. By the silence of the wall. Broken now. As if she, unlike Hans, in desperation, had removed the finger from the hole in the dike. The flood rushed in. Arousing in her a tingling that she could now understand. Released. It was second time that day that she had turned violet.
