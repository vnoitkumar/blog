Of all my paradoxes

The deadliest one is you.

For I can be selfless to the world

Yet expect the moon from you.

I fly over the seven skies

And expect to belong to you

Oh, I can face a harsh, harsh world

But break at an unkind word from you.

I can share everything I have

But not a drop of what is mine in you

I seek nothing from the world

Yet I need everything of you.

My love, Iâ€™m a never resting pendulum

Swinging between my extremes and you

I can be foolhardy, brash and lost

Blindly hoping to be understood by you
