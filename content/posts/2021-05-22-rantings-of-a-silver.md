*I do not know why people think it is their basic right to pick flaws in my mental makeup. The way they go on, one would think I was young Frankenstein reborn. You shouldn't shout at him at the top of your voice, they say. Hold it, why repeat yourself in the very first sentence. "At the top of your voice" is a part and parcel of shout. It is the emotional content that distinguishes the two. And yes, I Do talk to him at the top of my voice, All The Time. I need to, I'm forced to. He "Claims" to be deaf, doesn't he? I thought this was the one thing on which we were all agreed. Then, why the lecture when it takes your fancy?*\

*Always talking down to me with the superior air of an intelligent person patiently explaining worldly matters to a grossly deficient nincompoop. Trying to befuddle and bamboozle me with high falutin partial truths. As if I don't know A from B and B from A - totally unaware that I have allowed such gross misbehaviour simply because of a largeness of heart and in an attempt not to break what should normally be a happy lifetime relationship. Also not aware that severe pressure put on me in this relentless manner over the years will finally end up with me turning from just a depressive to a desperately depressed depressive?!*
