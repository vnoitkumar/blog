description: (written on a foggy morning by the banks of the Changu Lake, at a
  height of around 12500 ft, close to Nathula on the Indo-Chinese border.  The
  thick fog would part very briefly now and then, and the lake would shimmer in
  the faint sunlight for a moment before disappearing again into the
  fog.  Almost like a spirit . . . . )

**spirit lakes**

shrouded

in a world of fog

and mist.

a vulture

perched upon the roof

blinking ominously

at the past.

i stand at the window

my back

to the embers

of yesterday’s fire

waiting

for my call.

it comes.

oozing

out of the nothingness.

the fire dies.

i lock the door behind me

and strip

my body off my mind

and hang it on a tree.

and then i cut

and slash

cut and slash

until the fog

and the spirit lakes

turn red.

exhausted

i turn to the vulture

still on the roof

“take over,

ole friend.”

he swoops down

picks up the shreds

and flies away

away into the mist

and beyond

the spirit lakes.

my world clears . . . .

i can breathe, now!
