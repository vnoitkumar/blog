Peace, a reflection of my choice.

A Deep serene encircles me in stoicity.

The sparkle of a heavenly light,

That embraced my life with solace.

The journey tuned for miles.

With an urge for spirituality.

A dig deep inside the soul

Guiding my path towards divinity.

The encounter brings with it

A profound feeling of sonder.

And this moment of realisation

That goes far beyond the heart.

I swim through feeling catapulted,

And I walk with faith in bliss.

The sacred essence within me

Accelerates to experience the miraculous.
