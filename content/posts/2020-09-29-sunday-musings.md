They defy definition, these wonderful creatures,

For all that’s beautiful about them’s astern.

Was God having fun when he hung out their features

Or was this the tail end of divine inspiration?

Some say it must be a young graphic artist,

Who let his grey cells and his software go wild;

He made up these *things* for free and for gratis

And sent them to Cloud, like a mischievous child.

Like a child that has made very special mudpies

And plastered them on to his mama’s new fridge

And quietly slept to her sweet lullabies…

(Oh, at this stage, I’d rather my story abridge).

Let’s revert to our friends of feather, a-talking

Of plumage and courtship and girl-friends and fun

They speak of the time when they’re out there, a-stalking

And how those ol’ coattails will rise like the sun

The sun shall then shine through our golden-edged frond,

As we split the Spring air with harmonious song,

Two proper young ladies to the call will respond

In the flesh or in graphics … we’ll find out … ere long.
