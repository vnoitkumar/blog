Black is beautiful, white is alright,

A shade termed 'fair" is also known,

But its the many shades of brown

That provide such a splendorous sight.

The trunk of the tree is brown

Though its leaves are lovely shades of green

Does anyone look on it with a frown

And say 'that's not how you should've been?"

Mother earth is many shades of brown

With the most amazing hues mixed in between

Don't we all agree and own

That they're the most wondrous sights we've ever seen?

Why then do we differentiate

When it comes to human beings?

We forget that beauty lies in other things

Like good features and one's inner state.

The colour of the skin we even associate

With a person's ability and mental state.

Why do we feel we have the right to comment

On a person's personal choice?

On what they wore and where they went,

Why don't we appreciate their dignity and poise?

We are brown and that's what we'll be

Even if we deny it unto eternity.

Let's be happy we carry a genuine smile on our face,

And belong to an ancient and cultured race.
