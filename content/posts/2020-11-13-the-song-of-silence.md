They both sat down for dinner. He had asked the cook for chapattis and dal. As they started eating he said, " We should also become like Modi, no, the Gujaratis. We should learn to drink water and starve like they do. This meal after meal, forever needing to eat."

She blew her top. "I've had enough," she said. "You're forever pulling us down. You just won't give us a chance. At every meal you do your 'what does it matter what we eat. We just have to go through this daily grind, meal after meal' routine."

"I don't say it every day," he replied in his long suffering voice.

"Oh yes, you do. Anyway leave it, I'm tired."

"I'm more tired than you," he asserted.

"What is this 'more'? More tired than me. More of a headache than mine. More upset than me. What is this bloody measure you use that shows your 'more?'"

"O.K. From now on I won't say a word," he said and we continued to eat in silence.

She was really very angry. For the past two years they were eating the same three dishes that he liked for lunch and though he continuously spoke of cutting down on dinner, he never really made an attempt, hiding behind the statement "for the medicines we take we need to put in some food." Then why this pretence at disinterest? Why this act of somnolence? Why keep forcing himself to maintain an aura of physical renunciation? He unfailingly has his two to three pegs every evening doesn't he? Even that is ascribed to dealing with his incapacity to cope with his sorrow. How delusional can one get? Aren't we intelligent enough to realise that we have a number of years of life to lead and this is no way to go about it?"

Finishing dinner, he picked up his own plate, something he never does.

"You can leave it," she said and he did.

He moved to his usual after dinner position on the drawing room sofa, legs up on the centre table facing the mute television showing what, he knew not, cell phone in hand, totally absorbed.

Clearing the table and then the kitchen, she sat at the dining table to have her medicines.

She strained to hear something, anything, but there was only silence from his direction. Usually he would clear his throat or cough to gain attention.

"Poor chap," she thought," maybe he is still upset. I should calm him down. After all, he only has me."

As was her wont, she went and sat beside him on the sofa and patted him on his thigh.

He said, "So, you've finally calmed down, have you?"

She burst out laughing. What was this?

Super - iority? cillious? arrogant? insensitive? Or what?
