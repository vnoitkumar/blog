The gentle breeze before the downpour brings a storm of memories.\
The light drizzle makes me smile like an excited little child experiencing its first rain. The pitter patter of rain drops on my face make me feel the immense love you shower on me.\
The aroma of the earth gets my senses elated like that of a new found love.\
The thunder makes my heart beat like it was the first time I saw you and the cold air with the tingling of the wind chimes reminds me of a promise to an endless love.
