*Let others have their flashy toys*

*Their jazzy bikes, …those o’ergrown boys*

*While they enjoy the speed and thrill*

*I’ll dance to the rhythm of her laugh, that trill!*

*Let others have their gadgets new*

*Those iPods and airpods and what-have-you*

*They jump with glee on their pranks, their gaffs*

*I’ll hum to the tinkle and lilt of her laugh.*
