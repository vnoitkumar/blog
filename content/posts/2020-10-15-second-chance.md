The girl I know

Back from my school days

A good friend and

A wonderful human

With time we lost touch

Took different paths

And met again in life's rush

One day I read her story

That left me pained

I can't even imagine

How she managed it all

Without even letting

The world know

With two beautiful children

And an illness so rare

Weeks of uncertainty

With infusion of medications

And life that looked unfair

She gave a tough fight

Without making life look sad

She spoke about her story

And inspired people to look ahead

Her vision blurred

Her body hurt

Her soul shattered

But she kept her hopes

And that mattered

The only wish she had

Was to see her children grow

And that's what she asked

To God whenever she spoke

With the power of positive thoughts

The outcome was beautiful

My friend emerged

As a winner over life that could be awful

Today she is proud

Of her resilience

The power that helped her overcome

That would be silenced

Otherwise as an illness so rare

Life can be difficult

Life can be unpredictable

But only you have the magic

To make it awesome
