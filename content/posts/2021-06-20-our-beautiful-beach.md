The beach on a Saturday evening

Always ends up leaving

Me with a feeling of total happiness,

And really helps reduce my stress.

<br/>



All those happy faces

Leaving behind traces

Of sand wherever they walk

Casually chewing on a stalk

Of corn on the cob, or oh so

Enthusiastically eating spring potato.

<br/>

I walk and I rest and I walk again

Taking in the picture of unmitigated joy

For people no longer have to refrain,

Can happily come to the beach again.

<br/>

Fish of all types, shapes and sizes,

Smothered with masalas, waiting to be fried,

While the older sat and onions sliced,

Seeing me watching, the younger one smiled.

<br/>

Row upon row of coloured bottles put up on show

For *ice golas* made of RO water, we'll have you know,

Many flavours of *goli soda* for you,

Madurai *Jigarthanda* has found a place too.

<br/>

I am overawed by the aura of enterprise

The eagerness to work, compete and earn,

They've planned it as alternate shops a day

So that all of them in business can stay,

During the weekends its eateries galore

There's something for everyone in store.

<br/>

God has blessed us with the longest beach in the world,

Indiscriminately plastic and booze bottles on it we hurl,

Every hundred feet a bin pleads "Use Me"

Why do you think God gave us eyes to see?

<br/>

Visit the same beach on a Monday morning

And you get filled with an intense longing

To line up those revellers who enjoyed this place

And give them a nice tight slap on their face.
