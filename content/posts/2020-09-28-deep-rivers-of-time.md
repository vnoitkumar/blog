That's not how we are supposed to end!

Some bruises in the heart are hard to mend!

I treasure even the smallest thing you said,

From the beginning of time when we were burning on something beautiful!

Had written poems for that familiar face,

And all of that has now turned into a blurry vision!

Time is a profound river where you and I keep seeing and separating,

Thinking that there is another life, another day and another moment.

For years I waited in the same place,

Like a seagull standing on one leg without any clue!

But now I will stay light year apart,

To escape from the bountiful memory that keeps hitting me,

As coming closer will only end up you walking all over me again!
