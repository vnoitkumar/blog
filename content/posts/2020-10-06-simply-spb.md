As I lament for the eternal rest of an artist,

Who is gone to a place that is farthest-

From Terra mater, yet so close to the heart

Constantly boosting it with a jump-start!

Alas, age is just a number!

Forty thousand songs and fond memories to remember!

Wearied of continuous show for fifty days; after all, body is mortal.

The legacy of your profound singing is immortal!

Winner leads the paradise, they said!

Oh, why did you win? my eyes bled!

Will I obtain a glimpse of him in my dream, I doubt!

Ticket to The Heavens is sold out!
