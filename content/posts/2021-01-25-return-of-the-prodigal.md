He stood with his hands across the doorway\
Why have you come?\
\
Baba, I have come back to you.\
We have trudged all the way,\
Five hundred miles\
In the sweltering heat\
In the pouring rain\
Fearing for our lives at night\
Sometimes hiding under bushes\
Sometimes in gutters,\
Tired, hungry, forsaken by everyone\
And you ask me why I have come?\
\
I came dreaming of a pat on the back\
From you\
I came anticipating an embrace\
For my child from mother\
And you ask me why I have come?\
\
But you left me and went away.\
\
To earn a livelihood Baba,\
I've been sending money regularly.\
\
A pittance.\
\
He felt as if Baba had dealt him a hard slap on his face,\
My wife has also been working in the City.\
\
Now you want to live in comfort\
Is that why you came?\
\
No Baba, if I had to die I wanted to see you first.\
\
She stood silently through it all\
She hefted the bundle onto her head\
And lifted the child onto her hips.\
She took him by his hand and said,\
“Come, we did it once,\
We can do it again.”\
They turned around and walked away.
