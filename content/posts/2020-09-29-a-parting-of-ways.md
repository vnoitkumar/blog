goodbye, friend!

it was good knowing you

through a stormy, enriching ride

when, for a while

you put away your mask

and i, mine,

and reaching out

we touched each other’s

souls.

but then

why did we forget

that today’s comfort

was yesterday’s dream

where we risked all

and broke our ties

with tradition

to see a different

dawn?

if yesterday’s rebellion

could bring today’s joys

why do we fear to rebel today

for tomorrow’s

joys?

the caterpillar

is comfortable

firmly anchored on the stem.

what if it feared

the weightless

airborne freedom

of the

butterfly?

the mind awakens

into growth

as the body degenerates

into death.

creatures of doubt that we are

we keep the body company

as we recede, cringing,

into the cocoon of

mediocrity

while the unborn

freedom of tomorrow

weeps sadly at our fear.

goodbye friend . . .

i cannot walk with you

any more.

fear and I parted company

long ago.
