**RESILIENT SPOUSE Part I**

what you cannot cure

you’re bound to endure

he said

and when the wheel of life

turned round, gave him a wife

he wed

she was a haughty bride

so full of snoot and pride

‘n *her* house

she said it was so large

“it can hold a frickin’ barge,

you mouse!”

he never gave her cause

to sharpen up her claws

as she did

his tolerance enraged her

she screamed as he assuaged her

so irritatingly placid

as on and on she ranted

‘twas his ego that she wanted

to trod on

he, in quiet desperation

and *sans* exasperation

did plod on

his mother so polished and frail

heard his silent suppressed wail

and wept

as all those untold riches

with a multitude of glitches

in dusty courtrooms slept

to him she softly whispered

she’d barely got her lisp heard

o’er the din

I see here how you are living

so loving and forgiving

it’s a sin

but mother I can’t blame her

‘twas me and you who chose her

from many

I cannot now despise her

I’ve promised t’ have and hold her

Through cloudy days and sunny.

I have to stick it out

She is so obviously out

Of her mind

I’d rather live through hell

And pray that she gets well

And wifely,

soft

and 

kind.

**RESILIENT SPOUSE – II**

it was an arranged one

a stupid exchange done

of his unknown qualities and mine

with him was his mother

a sister and a brother

they came as though they had been called to dine

with suits and ties and perfume

to impress us I assume

and so it did I’ll surely not deny

for he was tall and handsome

his manners too were winsome

my mum was so happy she could cry

his father’d been some big shot

in a governmental hotspot

the son’s no less a shot mind you they said

mine was and is a doctor

in his field of quite high stature

the mansion is a witness, large n spread

I dreamt of him in white

all sparkling and so bright

the white horse that he rode was oh so frisky

when the honeymoon had passed

was I dumbfounded aghast

when he got into outfit which was khaki

now my life’s a tale in khaki

so drab, humdrum and tacky

with starch or not it just cannot be white

I will not e’er forgive him

for the dream I had about him

why can’t he change for something that is bright?

the khaki’s ingrained in him

his visage too is so grim

and happiness I doubt I’ll ever find

but I guess it has to be me

to take the lead and free me

from the slavery of white that’s in my mind

I’ll bloom where I am planted

real life is ne’er enchanted

unless we choose to think all frogs are princes

I’ll drop my dreams of white

why, khaki too is bright

and white turns dull in certain circumstances … …

and white turns dull in certain

circumstances …
