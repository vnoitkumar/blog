The waves receded into the womb of the sea

And in its cyclical magic of boundless glee

Ebbed and flowed, wondrous, magical and free,

Far towards the horizon that I could barely see

I walked beside the waves and felt my sorrows shed

My feet caressed by the warm, moist sand bed

I watched the rising, mellow, orange sun

And the birds framed mid-flight on the sky so crimson

I looked into the sand, an allegory of life itself

With myriad lines, circles, colours and shells

A beautiful kaleidoscope of exquisite patterns

Mesmerising, momentary, until the wave returns!

Time fragments the gossamer dream

The waves crash in, its designs to redeem

Erasing and weaving the sand afresh

A sublime vision hued by the morning blush
