The waves recede into the womb of the sea [](<>)

In its cyclical magic, boundless and free

Afar, the horizon I could just behold

With the ebb and flow my thoughts unfold

I walked beside the waves and felt my sorrows shed

My feet caressed by the warm, moist sand bed

I watched the rising, mellow, orange rays

And the birds framed mid-flight through the haze

I looked into the sand, an allegory of life

Myriad patterns of harmony and strife!

A beautiful kaleidoscope of exquisite patterns

Mesmerising, momentary, until the wave returns!

As time shatters a gossamer dream

And weaves again promises to redeem

The waves erase and sketch the sand afresh

A sublime vision hued by the morning blush
