This is an intriguing book that covers some aspects of the Portuguese regime in Goa.

It is special to me because it is a collection edited by a college-mate, a fellow traveller through the world of bean-counting. He went into poetry (no less than a Homi Bhabha Fellowship and a Senior Sahitya Akademi Fellowship under his hat!) while I went a-wandering… until some semblance of poetic inclinations drew me back….to Writers Ark! His first publication was “*A Guarded Space*” in 1981; his first anthology, *Ferry Crossing — Short Stories from Goa.* The book under review is an attempt to see Goa through the eyes of the numerous visitors (some friendly, some not so) over the centuries. In analysing these writings, Manohar observes that none of them mentioned Goa’s beaches “even in passing”.

When a poet takes to collecting old writings, he unwittingly carries with him his “undefined, marauding inner anxieties” lending a rather quaint yet delightful metre to his depiction, his introductory observations, and to the method of collection itself. The reading leaves you in a pensive-cum-elated mood as when you have ingested the umpteenth reading of the “*Ode on a Grecian Urn”* or *“To A Skylark”.* These “old writings” are personal accounts of times long gone by, which tend, by their very antiquity, to fascinate. And when those accounts relate to Goa – a land that has, over misty millennia, attracted wide-eyed visitors of every creed and profession, trade and politics – a deeper glow engulfs that fascination.

The book is divided into three parts *viz*. The Early Traveller, The Inquisition In Goa, and The Contemporary Traveller. The Inquisition (though containing only one account in the book) was the most degrading period of the Portuguese, church-dominated rule. Gabriel Dellon, the author of the piece, was persecuted for practising Judaism; his is perhaps the only eye-witness account of the period and needs to be read to understand the “universal and violent trembling” that the inquisition generated. Manohar, in his introduction, puts it in perspective: Dellon escaped detection as a Jew during his lifetime but, 12 years after his death, he was posthumously convicted, his body was exhumed and burnt at the stake; his sister however was burnt alive. As Manohar says: it savaged the social fabric of the place.

Among the “Early Travellers” is Duarte Barbosa who gives what is clearly an eye-witness account of a widow committing sati – though not in Goa (where it was banned by Afonso de Albuquerque), but in Vijaynagar. He was in Goa sometime between 1500 and 1517. Incidentally, Duarte Barbosa was the brother in-law of Ferdinand Magellan, earth’s first circumnavigator! The Italian Pietro Della Valle, who came to Surat in 1623 and went to Calicut, also speaks about Sati where he tried to dissuade a “willing victim” from this ultimate sacrifice. The next account is by one Fernão Pinto who accompanied the body of St. Francis Xavier to Goa. Anthony Monserrate, one of the Jesuits who spoke to Akbar about Christ, follows. There are several stories wherein Jesuit encounters with Akbar and his immediate progeny are described. Pierre du Jarric, a French Jesuit, professor at Bordeaux and a chronicler of the Jesuit Missions that arrived at the Moghul Court in 1580, 1590 & 1594 is one of them. Monserrate also reports discussions with Akbar about celibacy, marriage, spiritual children, and the Last Judgement.

John Huyghen Van Linschoten, in Goa between 1583 and 1588, recorded the decadence in Portuguese Goa during its incipient decline from its heights of glory. Ralph Fitch, the British pioneering traveller, around 1583, is supposed to have whetted the appetite of the East India Company. Among the better known of the early writers is Jean-Baptiste Tavernier **(**wealthy and famous diamond merchant who was in Goa in 1641 and 1648) who noted the rapid decline in Portuguese prosperity;Alexander Hamilton, Calvinist Scotsman, who was in Goa in 1692 &1704, gave a rather depressing account of the Portuguese – particularly the clergy – which was corroborated by Jacobus Canter Visscher, Dutch Pastor who visited Goa in 1717. Hamilton mentions the story of St. Francis Xavier’s arm being sent to the Vatican – the arm was sent to the then Pope who wanted proof that the body had not decayed. I was fortunate to see this arm honoured at the Chiesa del Gesu in Rome, and was dismayed to know that most of the people who had come to see the arm did not know that the whole body was here in Goa!

# ***Next is the work of a native Goan (Dr. Jose Nicolau De Fonseca who practised in Bombay): “An historical and Archæological Sketch of the City of Goa, preceded by a short statistical account of the Territory of Goa” is one of the most popular tomes on the Portuguese in Goa. One would have expected to find some writings about the period when Goa was occupied by the British between 1812-1815 during the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance during the Napoleonic Wars. But one cannot argue with the choice of the editor.***

Then there is a host of Contemporary Travellers that Manohar mentions in his introduction but does not include their works, including Somerset Maugham. Those who are included are Graham Greene (1964) and David Tomory among others. But the most interesting is the inclusion of Manohar Shetty’s own story: *The Shady Invasion of the Beach Umbrella*. Smacking of Abou Ben Adhem, this chapter ties up the purpose of the book. Here we find the real anguish of the Goan against the tourist-brochure type of Goa.

The book opens up Goa’s multi-layered past – far from the brochure ridden face that is presented today.
