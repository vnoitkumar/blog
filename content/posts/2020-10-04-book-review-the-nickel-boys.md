This book is not for the fainthearted.

There used to be a reformatory school in Marianna, Florida, called “The Arthur G Dozier School for Boys” – it was shut down in 2011 for its brutality. The ***survivors*** have a website – *officialwhitehouseboys.org –* andvery few among us would be able to read their blogs, because the first will shock you, the second will curdle your blood and the third, well … I couldn’t go beyond the second. Colson Whitehead, the author of the book under review, recreates the school as the “Nickel Academy” with its unique “training” for conversion of delinquents into “honorable and honest men”. Nickel, like Dozier’z, had a secret graveyard; it also had a “White House”, which was a shed in which laws were made – and implemented through steel-reinforced leather whips. The welts went beyond the skin. 

Elwood Curtis, abandoned by his parents, grew up at his grandmother’s, accepting her pragmatic responses to segregation while being inspired by the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr. This was the time when the decision in *Brown vs. Board of Education* had raised hopes that “all the invisible walls” would soon come down; that someday, Richmond Hotel would be open to “blacks” to stay and eat at, not just to cook and/or serve. At Nickel, Elwood was known as naïve and idealistic.

Decades later, a newspaper report carries a photograph of one of the Nickel supervisors, 95 years old, and decrepit, leaning on a cane, “but his cold steel eyes gave him a shiver”; later, when the secret graveyard is flashed on TV, he knows: “It wasn't far off at all. Never will be.” His wife recalls with anguish the nightmares that come to him, the ones he claimed not to remember – she took his head into her lap as he wept. She thought of how he could come out of “that place” and make something of himself, to become a man capable of loving her the way he did; the man she had come to love. He goes back for a reunion, and stays at the Richmond, now renamed Radisson, not realising that he was living out Elwood’s dream.

***“Even in death the boys were trouble,”*** starts the Prologue, and the reader is drawn immediately to the skeletons unearthed by archaeology students; to the story of lives endured “around” segregation; and the single, innocent act that lands Elwood into the reformatory, and Hell; this is followed by tales of unsuccessful escape attempts and their deadly consequences; the punishments and abuses; the unlikely friendships and survivals, and then … there are faces missing at breakfast that none dared to even whisper about.

The story is woven around the dire goings-on at the Academy but the base is the myriad daily experiences of the African-American in southern US. In a soul-searching moment, Whitehead asks through one of his characters: “How do you get through if every indignity capsized you in a ditch? One learns to focus one's attention.” In this book as much as in his Pulitzer-prize winning novel “Underground Railroad”, (published in 2016) Whitehead tells of the horrors of slavery and the plight of their descendants – and their unending, hopeless search for freedom and justice, … and human resilience against inhumanity.
