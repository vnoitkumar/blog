**om shanti, shanti, shantihi . . . .**



i was walking back

last midnight

lonesome

drunk

and cold, when

on a distant valley slope i saw

smoke

curling up from the trees

as though

from a solitary fire.

entranced

i left the road

and headed for the smoke.

i stumbled over stones

and fell into ditches as i ran

blind

and mad

and mesmerised

and as the first greys of dawn

spread in the east

i reached

the cave.

exhausted

i stopped a few feet away

and saw

him

sitting the fire.

his matted hair was long

and filthy

and tufts were missing

from his bleeding scalp.

his gnarled fingers were spread over the fire

seeking warmth.

there was something strange

something

familiar

and i stood

rooted to the ground.

the fire began to ebb

and soon

there was but a wisp of flame

rising from the embers.

he raised his withered hands to his head

plucked a tuft of hair

and fed it to the fire.

it blazed again.

i gasped

and he turned

and shock of recognition

was like a universe

imploding

for there beneath the blood

and filth, i saw

my face

my eyes

my lips.

for a long moment

his blood-red eyes were fixed to mine

dry

aghast

and then they filled

and boiling tears streamed

down his cheeks.

he spoke.

“it’s you!”

a statement.

“come,

sit by the fire!”

a command

i obeyed.

we sat for a while.

he spoke again,

“eat”.

i raised my eyes in query,

“food”?

he looked at me

then smiling slowly

wrenched a handful of flesh from his thigh

roasted it over the fire

and gave me to eat.

i ate.

it tasted delicious, this flavour

of death.

we ate

famished

starved

and as we ate i saw

my hair was getting matted too

my skin wrinkled

my fingers gnarled.

the fire was dying again.

he looked at me

from under his bloody eyebrows

his eyes

like hot gleaming coals, and said,

“the fire

is dying.”

i nodded

plucked a tuft of hair from my head

and fed it to the fire.
