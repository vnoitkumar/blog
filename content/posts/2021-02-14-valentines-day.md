It’s Valentine’s Day!

The self-appointed moral police notwithstanding, it is a day on which those of us who are on the better side of 50 can recall the many bitter-sweet stories from around the world. Perhaps, some of them are reflected in our own...

Shakespeare’s **Romeo and Juliet** will spring to mind immediately – an Englishman’s rendition of an Italian romance ending in tragedy. The Bedouin romance of **Layla and Majnu** is another … from classic Sufi literature, which Byron aptly called “Romeo and Juliet of the Orient” … also conjures up an all-consuming yearning of two halves of a single soul, and the obstacles placed by tradition and bigotry. The Indian film industry has been re-producing the story with apparently as much yearning as the central characters: there were silent versions in 1922 (remade into a “talkie” version in 1936) and in 1927; the Punjabi version came out in 1940. Hindi versions came out again in 1945 and in 1976, while a Telegu one came in 1949, Tamil in 1950 and Malayalam in 1962. Pakistan had its Urdu version in 1957. And then in 2018 came the modernised, Kashmir-based version of the theme. No comments!

The story of Salim (later Jahangir?) and the court-dancer is well-known. The 1953, black-and-white movie called ***Anarkali*** had been a huge box-office hit; in 1960 the multi-starrer ***Mughal-e-Azam*** playing the same story, is remembered equally for its grand portrayal of Emperor Akbar, and a sensitive depiction of his sense of justice. Following this in real life, we have Emperor **Shah Jahan’s** undying love for **Mumtaz** – and the marble wonder that eternalises his love, a silent eloquence on the power of love, sending a wistful gleam into every misty eye; Tagore called it “a tear drop on the cheek of time”; Lady Diana said that the visit was “a healing experience”.

In recalling romances among the royalty, can we ever forget **King & Emperor Edward VIII** of England who gave up his throne for his lady love? Which also takes us to ***Roman Holiday*** that wonderful, though fictional, romance of the British Princess Anne and the “common” news reporter (Joe Bradley) from the US. I enjoyed the conversation: when she talks about the pressures that are part of her life, Joe asks: “Why don’t you quit?” That’s an Americanism that the British Princess is not accustomed to using; her reply is classic, even the way she says: “quit”! And best of all is where he pretends that he has lost his hand in the “Mouth of Truth” … the beginnings of affectionate camaraderie … and then the concluding, no-nonsense, declaration to her entourage: *Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and to my country, I would not have come back tonight or indeed ever again!* (I blinked repeatedly, every time I read that as I was writing this!)

**Cleopatra**, who fell to the powerful Julius Caesar, was head-over-heels with **Mark Antony:** a sequence of misinformation (not unlike Romeo and Juliet) and they die, in each other’s arms. Sir Lancelot of King Arthur’s Round Table is another story of royalty: **Camelot** that had been built on love, crumbled at the feet of love. Arthur, as he dies, says: “Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot.”

Ireland has its own story of tragic love: **Tristan and Isolde** – a crucial lie, and Tristan dies a broken man, soon followed by Isolde. The story of Paris of Troy and Helen of Sparta (generally identified as **Helen of Troy**) is well-known. But the story of **Orpheus and Eurydice** are not known beyond pure literary circles, I think. This story is of rivalry over a woman (Eurydice) between Orpheus, a normal human, and Aristaeus, God of Agriculture. While fleeing from Aristaeus, she fell into a nest of snakes and died. Orpheus’ plight moved Hades to allowing Eurydice to return to Earth on one condition: Orpheus should walk in front of her and not look back until they both reach the upper world. In his anxiety he forgot and he turned to look at her, and she vanished for the second time, forever.



Everyone has heard of Homer’s **Odyssey** but few know about the fierce devotion-level fidelity shown by his wife, Penelope. When Odysseus was away at war, she had several suitors to take his place; she told them that when she finishes weaving her carpet, she would make her choice. Whatever she wove throughout the day, she would sit at night and unravel…and, by the time (several years down the line!) one of them discovers her secret, Odysseus is back. True love, strong and patient, won the day – but Pyramus and Thisbe, having misunderstood the signs on a passing lion, were not so lucky.

In more recent times, we have Margaret Mitchell’s ***Gone With The Wind***. Scarlett, a hot-headed, young girl is infatuated with her cousin, Ashley Wilkes, who is in love with the gentle Melanie Hamilton. Rhett Butler has taken a fancy to Scarlet but is held back by his own background…but gradually falls for her, and eventually she too veers towards him. The final scene shows how a show of apathy can cover the uncanny depths of love. A less sorrow-filled but highly eventful story is ***Jane Eyre*** as also is the tale of Elizabeth Bennett and Darcy in ***Pride And Prejudice.*** 

Goa has its own folklore of love stories, many of them sung in the local, soulful music of the *Mando.* That would be a study of its own, but the best-known story is that of Dona Paula. The Hindi film, *Ek Duje Ke Liye* spread a story about the two statues that stand on the cliff off the area known as Dona Paula, and hordes from the rest of India have come to see the place thereafter. The area lies on the southern face of the cape which stands between the two major rivers of Goa (the Mandovi and the Zuari); the Raj Bhavan is also on this cape, which has the two river waters mingling with the Arabian Sea at its base. Somewhere half way down this slope, stand two statues which have been the subject of much rumour, more conjecture, greater mystery.

Several stories have been circulating – that, the lady, Dona Paula (Dona is a form of address for ladies in Portuguese) appears on the moonlit waves wearing only a pearl necklace, which would have been interesting, if one wasn’t scared of ghosts! Another story, perhaps fed by the likes of *Ek duje ke liye,* is that she was the daughter of the Portuguese Viceroy, and she fell in love with a local fisherman; her father forbade her from meeting the fisherman. Paula, in despair, jumped into the sea, and the father, overwhelmed with grief, named the area after her. A third story, largely fed by the imagination of tourist guides, says that she was married to a poor fisherman, who ventured into the deep sea for fishing and never returned; his wife waited for him … for many years and … turned into stone. There is also a story about the lovers being from different castes/nationalities and rather than confront their parents and society, they decided to jump off the cliff.

I feel as if I am the villain telling you there’s no Santa Claus.

The place is named after Dona Paula, the wife of Don Antonio de Menezes Souto-Maior, and was related to the Portuguese Viceroy of Jaffnapatnam, Sri Lanka. She was known for her charity and efforts to improve the living conditions of the local people – in gratitude, the name of the village was changed from Oddavell to Dona Paula. She lies buried on the transept of the chapel inside the Raj Bhavan.

There is no Tooth Fairy either.

The statues are of the philosopher, Robert Knox, and his wife; sculpted by Baroness Yrse Von Leistner, and given to the Govt as part of her bequest, in the late-1960s.

I’ll end this Valentinian rumination with a special kiss for Tess (of the D’Urbervilles), my favourite heroine of all time. Her love for Angel Clare was complete and unalloyed (I’m jealous); he realised his foolishness after roaming half the world, that Tess was as pure of heart as one can ever hope for; and yet she would kill to be with him: ***but it was to be*** …as Hardy says, that “part and counterpart wandered independently about the earth in the stupidest manner for a while, till the late time came. Out of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks, catastrophes -- what was called a strange destiny.”

…tomorrow is another day!

Cheers!!
