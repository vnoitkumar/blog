The most beguiling eyes looking up at me from that corner,

"Come here," I called putting out my hands in a welcoming gesture,

She came and stood shyly in front of me,

Placing my hand under her chin the better to see,

I moved her odni from her face, God! Was she a stunner!

You're beautiful, I said,

No, I'm dark, with bended head,

Who said that, I asked angrily

Why, everyone, she replied matter of factly.

Tell them Devi Maa is dark too,

And I look like her, not you!

Her face lit up with a brilliant smile

She was filled with happiness for a little while
