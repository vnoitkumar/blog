Thank you dear Judge, you did not pass a restraining order

I had to live with the man who abused me and oh! It was such horror

I filed a case under the DV Act hoping for relief

But believe me, all it did was give me more grief

The Protection Officer, she promised me an ex parte

Only to resign soon, and not write any order

Restraining the abuser to stay away from me

He continued unabated, and said my fate was to lie at his feet

You just passed the case over, date after date

The order didn’t come though I came to court every time to debate

That I was innocent, and he should not stay with me

But no order came, and he continued to abuse me with glee

My daughters he would bring to court and show them

That their mother was a mad woman, hoping in their hearts hatred he could stem

I could not bear it anymore one day, after another heating of no avail I left in the night

Determined to survive and fight the odds with all my might

I took my aged father and two daughters with me

With hope to be happy and experience peace

But alas the abuser still chased me, hunted me down and stalked me

Filed a kidnap case so that with my daughters I could not flee

We ran to safety, hoping that things will settle

But the abuser, he showed his true mettle

My older daughter he poisoned - and bent her mind

And the new environment wasn't very kind

She hated the change, she longed for home

I told her to wait, so she could freely fathom

That life can be better if we are not controlled

We can choose to be what we want and not do what we are told

The child in grief decided to go back

I thought I would die of a heart attack

One day she went with her grandfather for a ride

And that my friends, just turned the tide

Her father came, lured her and took her away

My heart was empty, and I was at sway

I did not know what to do, I could not think

I cried all day, from morn until the sky turned pink

I could not bear to see her clothes in the cupboard

Or her younger sister longing for her or her grief or her outbursts

Is this how we are destined to live? apart like strangers, never to hug or embrace?

Oh Lord, I prayed, show me some grace

Like an eagle I chased the predator father

By then he had poisoned the vulnerable daughter

Venom she spat, blamed me and was full of spite

I on the other hand, had no respite

I had informed the school that she was taken away

The school did not give me a TC, so I told them to stay

Her readmission to the school so I could get her back

But the predator was already prepared for attack

The collector he propositioned, and painted me bad

The school readmitted the child, but they thought never mind, the mother is after all a tad mad

I found out and called them and they feigned terror

And spoke of how they had been forced to readmit her

An institution had fallen from grace

As they could not stand up for this kind of disgrace

Horrified,I called my friend who referred

Me to a lawyer that she preferred

I met her hoping for justice to prevail

But believe me again I fell off trail

I found a lawyer who promised to fight

Little did I know about her sorry plight

She did not know what to do and kept postponing the date

And I was tired of the justice being delayed

So here I was again at crossroads in life

Oh Lord, why did you make me this man’s wife!

So then I found someone dignified, to fight my case to reinstate my child

Justice they say, is never easy to achieve

Until then, that was not something I believed

I thought if I approach the courts I would be heard

But then I learnt that truth is often blurred

Many a times, I fought to bring her back

Only to see her return with her father and his sack

I knew that the decision was not good for her

But who was to hear me, my pleas fell on deaf ears

She would be sent back because they went by the book

Oh why could they not see the concoctions cooked?

Go back to your husband reconcile,

“No my honor” I replied, “he is very vile”

So then I got visitation to see her often

Thank you my Lord, so kind of you to soften

So off I went every other weekend

The younger child at the back, and a driver at the frontend

We would go to see her, but my heart would break

If only she could see the good life she could create

She was a teenager mature enough the court said

Teenagers are most confused, is what is so oft said

To see her after a year is not easy

I cursed and prayed that the predator is greasy

He should fall sick, the sky should fall on his head or he should disappear

My grief and longing only made my feelings reappear

I vented, lamented, cried and wailed

But justice is a long wait, my soul prevailed

Do not give up, there's a bend in the road

The bends and curve just tell you to change mode

From one of victim to take control

Stay behind the wheel and let it roll

There will be potholes, stones and thorns

At the end you will fly like a unicorn

So the trips were made and they did help

So my daughter's heart at last did melt

She has her own opinions about her life

But she knows both sides of the strife

Whose side she’ll take I don't know

I tell her to be strong and confident, learn from mistakes and grow

Now she years to return to me

But the predator has her in chains and she cannot flee

Here I go to approach the court again

Hoping for justice to remove her from his den

Giving up I know is not a choice

I know it is right to fight with poise

Her freedom and good life is all I seek

Alas! Justice cannot hear, cannot see or cannot speak!

But go I will after the predator unabated

Until I release her from his clutches for so long she has awaited

Determined to release her, bring her and let her flow

Into her life so her dreams can unfold

Into a new dawn of hope, peace and joy

So she can be the best version of herself and her life enjoy!!

Why am I telling you this story, pray

Because its a story of #resilience to fight, to stay and say ‘Nay’ to Violence
