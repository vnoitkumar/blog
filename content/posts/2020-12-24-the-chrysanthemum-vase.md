Jero sat by his window and stared vacantly into space. His thoughts wandered aimlessly through the cobwebs of his mind, where everything seemed opaque. He kept bumping into memories, that flitted away like wisps of clouds the moment he touched it. He tried hard to focus on something. Jero was 85. His eyes hovered fondly over the sleeping figure on the bed., his wife Jini. How won-dered how many years it had been since he married her.  Jero tried to think. He was unable to re-member. Decades for sure, he thought. Sadly, she had been ailing for some years now. Jini’s laughing face, clutching a bunch of chrysanthemums in her hands flashed across his mind from the distant past, bringing a faint smile to his wrinkled face. How she loved those flowers! Jero was often amused that she loved them more than any other flowers he got her when they were dating each other. This was one of his lucid memories. When he asked her once why she loved them so, she simply said, “ It makes me happy Jero . By the way Jero, did you know that this flower signifies happiness? 

Oh, is it Jero had asked rather surprised.
“Yes! Jini had said.  “Japan celebrates the festival of happiness on a day in September called the Chrysanthemum Day. Now did you know that?”

Jero had no clue. He was happy that Jini was happy. He got her a bunch of chrysanthemums eve-ry day. This was his only indulgence. She had a beautiful white handmade vase that she picked up from a street seller on a trip to the nearby town, and it was now a his life’s mission to put chrysan-themums into it each morning. Jini would see it as soon as she woke up, and a big smile would light up her wrinkled face! They had done it for years. Jero would walk across to the local flower seller’s cart. The flower seller would stock them every morning for him. Jero would then carefully carry them home and put them in the vase with some fresh water. On the days he did not get chrysan-themums he would be anxious and worried that Jini might not be happy that day. 

Jini was amused and always touched by his obsession to ensure she had her favourite flowers eve-ry morning, He would wake up early before Jini, rub his rheumy eyes, wear his glasses and walk off to the florist, walking stick in hand.  Amar the caretaker who would drop in for an hour daily to help with cleaning up the house and to take care of odd jobs would always tell him, “ Uncle, why do you want to risk the crazy traffic? You know they drive quite recklessly on these empty roads now. “ Son, The chrysanthemums, I must get them home”  He would say. 

Long ago they had run a tiny village theatre in a sleepy, nondescript coastal village called Mangao. The local villagers would troop in when a new movie played there and buy tickets for a small price. When they grew too frail to manage it they sold it and the small amount of money they got from the sale was their source of livelihood. Their life was quite spartan and it did not irk them. 

Jero and Jini lived in a tiny two room house, with a small kitchen and a little verandah where they would sip their morning tea looking at the sun rising from behind the hills. This was another ritual that gave them a sense of comfort. They would sit there for a while in companionable silence that the years of familiarity had gifted them. Sometimes they hummed the old songs from the broken records they played at the theatre and smiled at the memories. Most other memories were forgot-ten but the essence of their journey together bound them like thin unseen veneers. Jero and Jini had no children. Not that they had not wanted one. But that was long ago.

For a few years he had grown chrysanthemums, roses and lilies  in their little garden at the en-trance of their tiny home. They had no energy any more for gardening and the little space in front of their home was now overgrown as nature reclaimed her space and created her own little garden. There was a little curry leaf tree though that grew surprisingly well with lush green, fragrant leaves through the year. Jini liked to pluck some and flavour their simple meals. Jero and Jini would some-times admire the beautiful little wild flowers that now grew abundantly in the garden. 

Jero realised that he had been daydreaming!  Ht turned around and tried to get up from the window making as little noise as possible so he did not wake Jini up. She had been looking wan again yes-terday he thought with some concern. Jini was 84 and her rheumatism made walking painful. She managed to hobble around and cook a few simple meals for the two of them. She was also an asthma patient and her lungs had been weakening steadily for some years now. Jiro himself had his own ailments but he fretted about her.

He checked the road and hobbled across to the flower cart. The flower seller was fascinated by Jero’s unfailing dedication and secretly did not charge him the full price of the flowers. It was his daily act of kindness to hand over the flowers and take the money Jero gave him without counting.

A wide smile broke out on Jero’s wizened face as he took the chrysanthemums from him. He thanked the flower vendor and started his walk back home. He opened the door and went straight to the vase to place the flowers. He thought he heard a groan. His hearing wasn’t too good but he paused to listen. He heard it again and his heart lurched. He flung the flowers on the table beside the vase. And hobbled as fast as he could towards Jini. He found her fallen  on the floor groaning faintly.  Jero tried to bend down and touch her forehead. He suddenly found his voice and shouted , “Amar, Amar, where are you, help please! 

Luckily for Jero, Amar was walking in through the door at that moment and he heard Jero. He rushed into the room saying, Uncle!  Are you all right? What happened?

He saw Jini and knew immediately that she needed help. He rushed out to call the ambulance. 

Jero sat down on the bed, looking down at Jini. He looked completely forlorn. 
He could hear the sound of a wailing ambulance….. 

The paramedics jumped out and gently picked up Jini, placing her on the stretcher and taking her into the ambulance. Jero got in with Jini, holding her hands. The emergency room in the little local hospital took Jini in. Jiro waited outside, looking lost. The hospital scared him. He wanted to take Jini and go home. He felt the tears flowing and pulled out his handkerchief. 

A haggard looking doctor emerged from the emergency room.  She is very weak and frail but you may see her Sir. Her lungs are really weak” she warned. Jero got up and the doctor took him in-side. Jini lay on the bed with a drip tube attached to her. She smiled and whispered ,”Jero, sorry to scare you, are you all right? She was barely audible.

“Jini, You won’t leave me alone, will you?”  he mumbled, his eyes brimming.  They spent the entire day at the hospital. Jini slept most of the time and Jero kept watch. The nurses flitted in and out with brisk efficiency. 

The doctor came in and checked her the next morning. “ You may take her home this evening and let her rest, but take care and keep her medicines handy always. Here is my number - give me a call if there is an emergency”, she said kindly. 

The sun had flushed the sky a fiery red as it went down. Let’s go home Jero, said Jini softly with a smile! Jini had always been the braver of them. 

Jero was grateful. He was not sure how much time they had together, but he had this moment and this day. The very thought made him happy. He took her hand in his and walked with slow deliber-ate steps beside the wheelchair as the nurse wheeled her to the waiting taxi. 
He tapped the taxi driver gently and asked,  “Could you please stop by the corner for a moment?”. The young driver nodded and pulled up near the flower cart. With a smile, Jero held his hand out to the flower seller who handed him the usual bunch. When they got home, he was going to walk in first and place the chrysanthemums in the vase before he helped her inside, he decided! The very thought made him happy.

The setting sun cast its long shadows. For now, they went home to the white vase and the chrysanthemums.
