He woke up with a start. He felt something warm trickling down his nose, over his lips and down his chin. His hand flew to his face and when he brought it down, he saw blood on it. He panicked. He jumped out of bed. The sudden movement made the blood flow thick and fast. He screamed and called out. Hearing his panic-stricken voice his wife rushed out from the kitchen. She was horrified to see blood all over his shirt. She did not panic but tried to stanch the flow of blood with the kitchen cloth she was holding. She acted swiftly. She sat him on the armchair with his head tilted back. She called an ambulance. She then informed her father. He advised her to take him to that very well-known and very good medical college and hospital in a little town far away. They lived down South and it would take a while for them to reach the place.\
The little ones were entrusted to the care of an aunt.

Along with a good friend she started on the long trip to the hospital. Her father would meet her there. With every jolt of the vehicle the blood would flow again. At some point during the journey the flow of blood stopped miraculously. Holding on to the tiny Cross on her chain she prayed like never ever. When at last they reached the hospital a flurry of attenders and nurses wheeled him in. He had lost a lot of blood and looked pale and haggard.

The doctors came in. Their grave expressions frightened her. After preliminary examinations they decided to open him up. They did not like what they saw. They sewed him up again. They brought him back to the room.\
They gave him twenty-four hours, a time limit for his life. That was when she broke down. He was young. She was young and the children were little. Her heart wrenching sobs rent the air.

Siblings were informed. One by one they staggered in, late into the night.\
The next morning the Chief summoned a meeting. The doctors decided to operate. It was a tough decision with a very slim chance of recovery. The evil cells had spread like wildfire. They were closing in on the brain.

He was in a daze. He felt a flurry of movement in the room. He heard the murmur of soft voices, figures in white were moving in and out on silent feet.\
Now they were taking him somewhere. Where was he going?\
Then he seemed to hear the soft closing of a door and then he heard no more.

She stood waiting outside. She lifted her voice to the Almighty. The hours would never end. After what seemed an eternity, they brought him out. Doctors were all around him. In the deep abyss of his mind he could hear someone saying that it was a miracle and there were no scientific reasons. What did they mean by that?\
He slowly opened his eyes. There before him stood the beautiful loving woman he had married, smiling at him with that beautiful smile of hers. He reached out for her hand and held it tight.\
He looked around. Where were his princesses? He wanted to see them and hold them close, but it was not to be so. He had to wait.\
"I must live", he said.\
"I must live for them".\
Six long months in that hospital room.\
Radiation and myriads of procedures\
At the end of it all his handsome face was reduced to a mere blackened shell. His mouth was a big hollow with no teeth and no palate. His right eye was not in its place. It was covered with skin.\
But he was alive!\
His steely resolve to overcome all difficulties stayed with him.

He thanked and praised his Creator. He drew closer to Him. He became a source of strength and courage to others in the hospital. His smile and banter endeared him to them. His trials had not robbed him of his hearty laughter. It could often be heard down the corridor and it would make the sisters smile.

Then it dawned, that wonderful beautiful morning when he could return home. His little ones were waiting for him. He scooped them into his arms and smothered their tiny faces with kisses. Then he cried! They held on to each other, all four of them, never wanting to let go, laughing and crying as they stepped into their home.
