*The sky at dusk was, ablaze, glowing,*

*As the smoldering embers coalesced into mourning*

*<br/>*

*The uneven structures tottered into the silhouette*

*A virus amuck hastening human to lifeâ€™s sunset*

*<br/>*

*A sojourn so final, a point of no return,*

*Much as loved ones may grieve and yearn*

*<br/>*

*The beseeching wails for the breath of life*

*In a cylinder, at a price that ignites strife*

*<br/>*

*The conflagrant sky softened its ire*

*The pyres died down, memories afire*

*<br/>*

*The sea embraced the setting sun*

*Fleeting, amber rays, the day now done*

*<br/>*

*Relinquishing a beauty so painfully exquisite*

*Spun by the gossamer dance of the infinite*

*<br/>*

*Knowing that days ended and lives lost*

*Will never return after the horizon is crossed*
