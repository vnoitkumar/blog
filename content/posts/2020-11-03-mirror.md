*Shiny little thing, open up!*

*And show me who I am.*

*Am I the beautiful Snow White,*

*Lovable and pretty and pure as snow.*

*Am I the darling little princess Cinderella,*

*Who could take pride in taking the hand of the rich Prince.*

*Am I the darling Mumtaz to her beloved Shah Jahan.*

*Am I young and lovely blessed with the fountain of youth.*

*Tell me Mirror, you shiny little thing,*

*Have you shown me my true self?*

*The beauty of my heart and soul,*

*Are they beautiful enough?*

*Are the words soft, thoughts noble?*

*Are the actions kind and charitable?*

*The beauty within me, my true self*

*The beauty only you can see and reflect*

*Wake up, Mirror, show me who I am.*
