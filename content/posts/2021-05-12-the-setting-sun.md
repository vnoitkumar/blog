*The painting is one of immense beauty*

*But seems to be portraying gloom?*

*Should we look at the positive side*

*And dwell on the glowing sun about to hide?*

*The ominous gathering of dark clouds*

*Foretell another bout of rain.*

*Like the raging storm just gone by,*

*Or just a mild shower on the soggy plain.?*

*The majesty of the setting sun*

*Fills the sky with a Chiaroscuro of colour,*

*After days of dull grey evenings*

*Leaves us looking on in rapture.*

*The wooden logs stand sentinel*

*In a straight line on the sand,*

*And warn fickle human beings,*

*Of the looming danger at hand.*

*The sea tired and spent in the storm,*

*Is yet to regain its beautiful blue sheen,*

*But happy to receive the sun's warm glow,*

*On its weathered waves in between.*

*It is nature's way of showing us,*

*That storms like disease are but a part of life.*

*We need to act sensibly without making a fuss.*

*Not as if God is just loading us with strife.*

*Maybe sometimes He just feels the need*

*To shake us out of our insatiable greed.*
