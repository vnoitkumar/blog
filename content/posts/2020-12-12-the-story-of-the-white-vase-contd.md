So, what happened to the two, nestled together facing the gurgling brook, immersed in the intense joy of first love’s look? What usually happens! They lost all consciousness of time and by the time they returned home, Shirley’s parents had sent the gardener in search of her. Her father was livid, peremptorily dispatched her to her room and sent John on his way, threatening him with a thorough hiding if he saw him on their property ever again.

Did Shirley collapse on her bed weeping? No, not at all. She cursed herself for not being more careful. They should have come back earlier. But she smiled to herself thinking of the pleasant time she had spent with John. What fun they had had together. It was the muffins and tea that kept them there for a longer time, or else, they may have come back because they were hungry! She would wait for her father to cool down and then contact John again. She was sure that he would also think of ways and means to contact her. After all, he *was* two full years older than her and very intelligent at that. He had completed his High School with superb grades. In just a little more than a year, she would be graduating too.

Shirley’s father was sitting in his study nursing a drink. He was not at all happy with the situation. He was very fond of his only child. She was the apple of his eye. He had been worried that she would return the food tray sent up to her room untouched. But no, not she! She made a happy meal of it and returned an empty tray. Chip of the old block, he thought proudly. Has guts, this girl of mine. But he could not really sit back and watch while she gallivanted all over the countryside with a village yokel. Tut Tut! He chided himself, do not think like a pompous ass!

He went up to Shirley’s room and knocked on the door. He went in and sat on one side of her bed. Patting the bed, he asked her to sit. Tentatively, she sat beside him.

“What *is* this behaviour,” he asked.

“Papa, I love John. Truly I do, from the bottom of my heart. I want to marry him,” she said.

To say that he was totally taken aback would be putting it mildly. “Aren’t you a bit too young for this decision? Oughtn’t you to see a bit of the outside world before you decide about love?”

“Papa, sometimes you just know inside that this is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with. You said so yourself about mother,” she said, smiling impishly.

“Yes darling, but not at the age of sixteen! Suppose I want to put your love to test?”

“I’m ready,” she replied immediately.

“Even if I say you shouldn’t see him till you are Eighteen? And I don’t expect you to cheat on me!”

“Done.”

“O.K. Let me think this over,” he said, kissed her goodnight and left the room. A lot can happen in two years, he thought, satisfied.

“Bloody shit-hole,” John cursed, as he neatly slid himself into the small space provided in the B-17 Flying Fortress for the Ball Turret Gunner. It was the most uncomfortable and difficult gunner position in the bomber. They took off on his first sortie, headed towards enemy lines. Enlisting in the Army, he completed his basic training as a member of the Army Air Corps and was stationed in a small town a short distance from London.

As usual, his mind strayed to his last meeting with Shirley. He had arrived at their doorstep with a large bunch of posies picked from the valley. She had come running out to meet him. Handing her the flowers he said, “Wait for me till your eighteenth birthday. I will be here to claim you for myself.” She kissed him and replied solemnly, “I will be waiting for you John.” He doffed his hat, climbed onto his cycle, and rode away. As he shifted himself to a slightly more comfortable position, her father’s voice boomed in his head. “I will not give my daughter’s hand in marriage to a lazy youth who is quite happy whiling away his time in his father’s bakery. Prove yourself worthy of my daughter’s hand and then come to claim her.”

Waving to John till he was out of sight, Shirley went straight to the white vase, removed the chrysanthemums that were arranged in it and placed the bunch of posies in it. She called for the gardener and informed him that she wanted a bunch of wildflowers every day for the white vase. The white vase had somehow turned into a vital link between her and John.

\* \* \* \*

There was a sudden loud bang and the aircraft shuddered. They had been hit. One of the engines caught fire. Everyone got up from their positions. John could not get out of his position without help from anther gunner. Everyone was heading towards the open door. John noticed that the Radio Officer was missing. He rushed in to look for him. He had been struck on the head and was lying dazed near his post. John hefted him up to a standing position and supporting him by the shoulder, he dragged him to the door of the plane. By the time he figured out a way to strap himself to the Radio Officer, a blast of fire from the burning engine hit him and scorched the side of his face. He parachuted out hanging on to the now unconscious Radio Officer with all his might. The chill breeze that hit them was like a balm to his burning face. They crashed into a clump of trees and landed on a branch a few feet above the ground. It took a lot of time and effort to extricate the two of them and finally land on the ground. Exhausted, they both lay side by side. By this time, the Radio Officer had regained consciousness. “I will never forget what you did for me, mate,” he said. The parachute on the tree being a perfect giveaway of their position, they slowly made their way deeper into the forest. After walking for almost two days, they were picked up by a military vehicle. Their own? The enemy?

Shirley came down to see a bunch of chrysanthemums placed beside the white vase. She immediately got irritated. She had made it abundantly clear to her mother that the white vase was hers and would only hold wildflowers. The vase has been in the family for four generations her mother claimed, and we have such a lovely garden with some very rare flowers. Surely, I can use it at least on special occasions? There are enough rare vases in the house for your rare flowers, Shirley retorted. This white vase is mine and will only hold what I put into it. If you want, I will move it to some other place in this room. After putting up a rather continuous resistance, her mother finally gave in after her father intervened on Shirley’s behalf. The gardener had brought her pretty wildflowers from wherever he could every single day. Then why the chrysanthemums today, she wondered and sent for the gardener. He claimed that he just could not find any flowers. He had sent the boys to scout far and wide but to no avail.

Shirley was crestfallen. Was this an omen that something was wrong? Somehow, she had managed to maintain a positive mindset despite not hearing from or seeing John for so long. She had clung on to the strength of her love for him and kept herself totally occupied. But the chrysanthemums seemed to be a harbinger of doom. Had he forgotten her? Was he in love with someone else? Or was he in some sort of trouble? Or worse still was he hurt or sick? That she would not be able to bear. God, keep him well, she prayed. She picked up the chrysanthemums but just could not herself to put them into the vase. She heard boots on the porch and turned to look.

“John,” she cried, dropping the chrysanthemums as she ran to him.

“How are you, my dear,” he asked in a rather solemn voice.

“Oh John, How I missed you,” she said laughing while her eyes filled with tears of joy.

He was standing rather stiffly with his hands behind his back.

“Is something wrong,” she asked.

He turned his face. One side of his face was still raw from the burns.

She put her hand up and very gently stroked his face. “It must’ve been terribly painful,” she whispered, placing her head on his shoulder.

“Can you still love me Shirley? It may never heal totally.”

Looking deep into his eyes, “It is *you* I love John,” she said.

John’s face broke out into a wide crooked smile. He brought his hand from behind his back and handed her the largest bunch of posies she had ever seen.

Gurgling with laughter she pulled him into the house.

“I’m being sent to Cranwell for training to become a Commissioned Officer in the RAF,” he said proudly.

“And I’m coming with you,” she replied gaily, arranging the flowers in her lovely white vase.
