I had a veritable riot on my hands.

It was a lazy Saturday afternoon. After a late lunch I would have dozed off to sleep in the wicker chair on the breezy veranda, reading Chekhov’s short stories. I was at the end of the 18-page long introduction by Maxim Gorky, and was ruminating on the last line: “We all hunger for the love of our fellow creatures, and when one is hungry, even a half-baked loaf tastes sweet,” when the phone rang. I was hoping that the caller would give up by the time I could pick it up – but it had an insistent ring about it.

It was the Security Officer. It’s not often that you find an army officer in a disturbed state of mind but this guy was nearly getting a heart attack and was about to make it communicable.

“Sir! There’s a crowd gathering in the Type I area!” he was shouting down the telephone. I was wondering if there is a decibel limit on the system when the line would cut off suddenly.

“Any idea what it is about?”

“No – no – no … I am trying to find out … but they are all armed with sticks!”

“Sticks, Major? Are you afraid of sticks now?”

I was mentally reciting the old “Sticks and stones may break my bones …”

“You’re joking, Sir?”

“Ummm…” That brought me down to earth. The light-headedness from the beer vanished in a poof. “Ok. What is the size of the crowd?”

“It is about 200 at least!” His voice was a bit calmer now.

“Have you contacted the local police? What do they say?”

“I need your clearance before calling the police in …”

“You have it. Please call them. The usual. The crowd needs to be blocked from wherever they are planning to go. Please make that clear to the police.”

“Yes Sir!”

That was it. My Saturday afternoon was up in a storm. I called for my jeep which was meant for such assignments, and started getting ready. The phone started ringing again.

“Sir!!” This time I was sure that the phone would explode.

“I am coming out there. Where are you and where is this crowd?”

“Now, there are two … two crowds!! The earlier one was in Type I area. The new one is in Type III area.” I was mentally mapping out the distances and the kind of persons living in each of the areas mentioned, while I was talking to him. One was workmen the other was the clerical and other staff.

“Ok. First let me know what the police had to say.”

“They have very few people, but the Sub-Inspector is already in the Type I area.”

“Good. Please go there yourself with your staff, and find out what all this is about. I am moving to the other place. We need to know the cause before we do anything.”

Before leaving my house, I put in a call to the local Superintendent of Police, informing him of what was reported to me, what was apprehended, and requesting him to send in reinforcements if necessary. Information would go to him via the police channels as well as the Security Officer.

In the type three area, there was a crowd of around 50 but it was growing. The gathering formed up around the jeep like an amoeba which was about to split. In the cacophony that followed I found, to my great relief, that there was no grouse against the Management this time. It was not some trade union reaction to some decision we had taken during the week that was about to end in a ruckus.

So, the story in short was that a school teacher who belonged to a certain community (it is not political these days to mention the names of communities) would call his students after-hours to help them out with their studies. It wasn’t called “private tuitions” because that was a punishable offence. So, a girl who had been detained in her class the previous year (yes, the story goes that far back in history when detention was permitted) had come for some clarifications the previous evening.

She came back an hour later. At the evening meal, she was silent, and picking at her food distractedly. The mother noticed it and asked her about it, she just shook it off. Late in the night, the mother woke up to hear her sobbing quietly. The mother crawled softly towards her, held her in a close embrace, and asked her what had happened. With her tear-ridden face against her mother breast, she sobbed out the details. The mother joined in her tears … and asked her not to speak about it. It was a case of our *izzat*, she said.

It’s an odd concept, this *izzat.* Literally, it stands for ‘honour’ but it means ‘reputation’ and ‘family name’; it also means that the girl in these circumstances would always be blamed, would always be remembered for whatever had happened with her; it also means that the man responsible for it would be long forgotten, but people would identify the family as the one where the daughter was … 

Her father had heard the sobbing, had seen his wife crawling around in the dark to the daughter … and he was fuming. While the girl, having emptied her feeling of guilt and shame to her mother, slept under her mother’s protective arm, he was tossing and turning until it was time for him to get ready for work. He was on the “first shift” which started at 0600 and went on till 1430. He would speak to the leader of his community and find out what can be done. This was not something that one can discuss with the wife, he decided; our friends are better advisers.

But friends are not always well-wishers. Leaders are even worse. The news spread like wild fire among the community members. And they gathered at the girl’s house. Sticks and stones. The mother held the corner of her sari in her mouth and wept. The crowd thought that her tears were for whatever had happened to her daughter, and the sympathy gave in to a renewed rage. They would teach that school master a lesson he won’t easily forget. They could not understand that she wept for what they were doing… about something she would have liked them to forget.

And, what about the other crowd?

That was another case of honour. They belonged to the community of the school teacher. Their grouse was that the name of the community was besmirched by this fellow. And he needs to be made an example of. “We are outsiders here,” they said, “and any one of us doing such things will spoil our name. The local people will not allow us to live here …”

What it boiled down to was that there were totally about 300-400 persons who were heading towards the school master – and his chances of survival were minimal. What do you do under such circumstances?

I informed the crowd at hand that they couldn’t take the law into their hands, that the action would only lead to criminal cases being lodged against them; that if they allow the Management to intervene, maybe we could do something that would assuage their fears … There was a reluctant, simmering calm; the anger had not entirely settled. But with clear orders to those whom I could recognize (and they knew that I would remember them) that their plan should not be carried out … I left the place. I rushed to my house, quickly asked the Superintendent of Police to pick up the school master for his own safety, place him under arrest or whatever, but he needs to be removed from his quarters immediately. Whatever action could be taken against him would start on Monday.

Ten minutes later, as I was talking to the girl’s parents, I heard the police siren resounding in the distance, and I knew that I had saved the life of one despicable person.

As I approached the Type I area, the crowd seemed restive but the cordon was effective. I requested the parents to come out so I could talk to them. From the majesty of the seat of a Willys Jeep, I heard the entire story. I saw the father’s rage while the mother stood in silence. The tears were flowing. All she could say was: *Now everyone knows.*

We can fight and scream and kill each other in the name of honour, she said. But the one who has lost it, has lost it.
