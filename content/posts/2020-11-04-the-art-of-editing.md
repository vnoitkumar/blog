***The Art of Editing***

This article is about editing. A checklist for self-editing or editing other’s work. This list is not exhaustive or exclusive.

Here is a plotline

Once upon a time, there was a man selling caps. After a day’s hard work, he was exhausted and caught a few winks under a tree. Upon wakening up, he was startled to find all his caps stolen by the monkeys that lived in the tree. He did not know how to gather them back from the monkeys. He took out the cap he was wearing and scratched his head. He noticed that the monkeys in the tree imitated him. An idea struck him. He threw the cap down. The monkeys did the same. Collecting all the caps, the man left the place.

Say this story has been turned into a narrative and you are trying to edit the work. These are things you should look out for.

Are the **characters** consistent throughout the narrative?

Is the man in the story is a smart alec or a simpleton? He can be either but he ought to remain the same throughout the narrative. If the story is about the man starting out as an imbecile and turning worldly-wise, then appropriate and plausible reasons must be included.

Is the **Genre** consistent?

The story can be folklore, realistic fiction, or thriller. It can even be an amalgamation of genres eg. urban legend, humorous thriller. But the sudden shift from one genre to another should be avoided as it might leave the reader bemused eg. starting out as horror and ending it as comedy. It might even be akin to cheating the reader of what was expected of the writer.

Is there **Point of View** consistency?

The above story can be from the POV of the head monkey, the man, omnipresent, or even the cap or tree. But the point of view has to be consistent or in the case of multiple POV, identifiable. Assuming that there is only one POV, then the same has to be maintained throughout the story. Starting out with second person POV and ending it with third person POV is a big no, no.

Are **the subplots necessary**? If so does it integrate well with the story?

One of the monkeys had an altercation with another monkey and that led to one being ousted from the tree. As much as this subplot sounds dramatic and entertaining, would it justify its presence in the given plot?

Is the **story well-paced**?

The story can start languidly, taking its own time to unravel or the narration can jump straight into the conflict scene. But it should hook the reader at appropriate places and provide relief when necessary. In the above story, say we are at a point where the man is perplexed about losing all his goods to the chattering monkeys, that point of time would not be appropriate to describe the beautiful sunset and wondrous clouds. At the same time, after a draining emotional scene, a break in form of descriptive writing could provide relief to the reader.

And a recap of the structural editing checklist

1. Character consistency
2. POV consistency
3. Pace maintenance
4. Do the subplots take the story forward?
5. Genre consistency

Now on to the next point

6. Chronological consistency

Your narration can be liner or nonlinear. But the chronological consistency is a must. In the above story, if the man was tired at the end of his evening and had slept for an hour, you cannot write, the sun was blazing above his head when he woke up. Neither can you write the man was tired at 9 o clock in the morning unless a reason is stated specifically for his tiredness at the start of the day.

7. Fact checks

Some facts can be tweaked a little and can be defended as artistic liberty. However, some are non-negotiable. Historical and scientific facts are better stated in their absolute truth.

Eg- “A group of proboscis monkey climbed down the red jasmine tree and snatched away the caps from Sekar” sounds absurd.

Now that the structural editing is done, we can move on to next stage of editing

It involves languages, tone, voice etc. Most of us spot structural mistakes of the story instinctively. However, the next step of mistakes might be difficult to spot.

1. Language.

The language can be archaic or simple depending on the narration you chose. It may be in regional dialect or folkloric. If the story is about two scientists conversing about doomsday, a few technical terms can be expected but not many metaphysical terms. The language has to thus complement the narration and POV. In the above story, say the narration is from POV of the cap seller, then a sentence like this might not look appropriate. “It was a languorous evening and I decided to smoke my bidi under the resplendent trees. A smothering lethargy overcame me and I slipped into a delicious slumber.”

Unless the cap seller is an English professor who had lost his job recently, it is difficult to imagine such lines in his narration/ thoughts.

2. Word selection

Can a better word used to create intended effect of the narration?

(comical, satirical or tragic). Can the adverb be replaced with a powerful verb? Can a simpler specific word be used instead of inappropriate words?

“The curious monkeys went near the sleeping man with trepidation.”

“The curious monkeys sidled towards the sleeping man”

We have had a bird’s eye view of the story and taken note of the jarring error. Now is the time to bring into focus the chapters, paragraphs, language, and sentences.

Recap

1. Language
2. Word selection
3. Sentence construction

Not all poetic sentences need space in your story. The writer should stay true to the plot and narration foremost. A beautiful sounding sentence in an inappropriate place is as bad as a grammatical error. It mars the flow. Vice versa hold true too. In a lyrical narration, sudden jump to colloquial language stands out like a sore thumb.

Eg - “After a refreshing nap, the cap seller awoke and was startled to find the caps missing. At first, he thought it might be the handy work of the urchins loitering around. However on hearing excited chatters from the branches of the tree above, he realized that his caps were stolen by the moneys.

“Woe thee be, Primate, “he cursed the robbing scoundrels.

4. Repetitive and clichéd word.

Certain words in your story might stand out due to its appropriate usage. But overusing it might dull the revelatory effect of the word. Sometimes, the same information is repeated again and again that it might wear out the reader.

Eg Repetition – “The cap seller found out that the monkeys mimicked his actions. And so he threw his cap away and hoped the monkeys would mimic him again. And lo behold, they did mimic him”

Eg - Cliched -“The cap seller felt they were monkeying around with him (pun intended).”

5. Run on sentences

This is a writing mistake that every one of us has committed at some point. Run on sentences is when two independent sentences are squished together without appropriate punctuations or conjunctions. Do read the example sentence

Eg – “The cap seller was tired, however, he had to carry on, he had mouths to feed.”

In the name of conveying desperation, three independent clauses are cramped into one sentence. Some consider this stylistic error rather than grammatical one. Whatever might be the case, run on sentences are frowned upon. 

Eg - “The cap seller was tired. However, he had mouths to feed and he had to carry on.”

6. Sentence fragmentation

Again, many of us are guilty of writing fragmented sentences. Sometimes, the broken sentences are even defended it in the name of lyrical prose.

Eg – “The sleeping cap seller had many coloured caps and each monkey picked up his favorite colour, not minding the deafening snores.”

In the above sentence, who snored? The monkey, the man, the cap or the colour?

Long sentences conveying ambiguous meaning forces the reader to go back and forth and tires him unnecessarily.

7. Active vs passive voice

Selection of active or passive voice depends upon the subject the writer wants to focus on that particular sentence.

Eg – “The monkeys were awed by the colourful caps. The wise one wanted the blue colour and the swanky guy preferred the red cap”

Here passive voice is used and the focus is on the monkeys. (How each one decides to take a particular colour,)

Eg – The colourful caps got the monkeys’ attention. The red cap with the feather, the blue one in with plastic flowers.

Here the attention is on the caps (How there were many interesting choices)

Finally the must-mention show vs tell.

This has been discussed widely and probably you know it by now.

Now that we have scrutinized our work from all the above angles, then is the time to take out the magnifying glasses and check for grammar, Sentence by sentence, word by word. This is proofreading and possibly the last stage of editing before your work goes out for public eyes / beta read.

\-Spelling and spelling consistency (UK English, US English)

\- Tense consistency

\-Grammar in general, punctuations, syntax errors.

\-Dialogue tags.

Finally, font, its size, spacing etc
