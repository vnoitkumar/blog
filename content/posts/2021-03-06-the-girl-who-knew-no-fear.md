Saro tucked the *pallu* of her half sari into her waist, hurriedly knotted her hair above her head and ran like the wind, right into the fire. There was a determined glint in her eyes as she looked at the leaping flames. This is a story of the girl who knew no fear.

Saro was born in the sleepy township of Kottakkal in the Malappuram District of Kerala, Southern India. The year was 1926 and the country was still under the British occupancy. Raised by her mother; a woman of grit, who was widowed at the age of 36, Saro was the third of her parents eight children. It is said that they lost a sibling or maybe two to illnesses as was common those days. Saro was the quiet, sensible, and efficient one who naturally gravitated towards being a source of support to her mother as the large family of children grew up. Saro’s mother Lakshmi Kutty Amma, was an indomitable woman, intelligent and always thirsty for knowledge. She could recite from her mind huge Sanskrit shlokas accurately. She was a respected figure in the township and people looked up to her for advice on a wide variety of issues both spiritual and about their mundane lives. Saro’s maternal grandfather was the *Samoothiri* (Zamorin), a local monarch who had absolute control of a swathe of provincial states,

Grandfather, however, was a soft, saintly, and just man who often struggled to manage the politics surrounding his position of power. However, he would always be surrounded by sycophants and family members, ready with devious plans to get hold of land and wealth under his seal. Grandfather was aware of this and trusted none but his daughter whom he fondly called “Ammu”, Saro’s mother, to hold such people in check. None dared tread anywhere near her. When Saro’s mother received an appeal for support from her beloved father, she entrusted the ancient home to Saro and the older siblings and went off to offer aid and counsel. Ammu was also a champion of justice and fairness and would not allow anyone to exploit her father’s name or power illegally, if she could help it. She stood like an insurmountable wall between the wolves and her *Samoothiri* father.

But alas, this left the children alone at home with a caretaker. They lived in an old home, with cool dark nooks and corners, an ancient kitchen where food was prepared on firewood gathered from the land around the house, enormous wooden doors, and high ceilings. The firewood was generally fallen dry leaves, dried coconut fronds, coconut shells, and some chopped wood. An old family retainer cooked their simple meals for them every day. Just outside the house, tethered with coir ropes, was a stable with thatched roof, that housed the beloved cattle of the family, a cow, a buffalo, and a couple of calves. The children had ample milk as a source of nourishment, and they all loved the cattle.

The children played together, the older ones watching the younger ones in their mother’s absence. After school, it was mandatory for all the children to have the daily customary dip in the temple pond and offer prayers at the temple. They then had to rush home to say their prayers aloud sitting in front of the lighted lamp. Homework, and study for the next day was followed by a spartan dinner after which was the strict, non-negotiable bedtime.

One evening, as the children prepared for bed, one of the younger children saw a glow outside and shouted fearfully, “There is a fire!” *Theeyu* (fire!) Fear permeated every corner of the house and every child's heart… There was sheer panic. Nobody knew what to do. The caretaker was away on some errand. There were no adults around. The sun had set and neighbours were inside their homes as was the practice those days.

Saro, all of fourteen years old, heard the cry and went running to the door. She saw the flame engulfing the cattle shed from one side and moving steadily towards the house through the thatched roof making its way towards the coir ropes that tethered it to the roof of the house. In an instant she realised that the fire would burn down their home in minutes, and perhaps take her whole family with it.

The rest of the children stood rooted to the spot when they saw a slim, athletic Saro leap out of the house and charge towards the stable with something in her hand. They wailed in terror as the flames rose higher. Saro ran to the ropes first and steadily and calmly chopped them off with her knife using all her strength, thus searing the connection between the house and the stable. Not content with that she rushed into the stable and cut the ropes of every animal tethered there. The frantic animals ran as fast as they could to escape the searing heat. She then rushed out and gathered all the people around for help. Neighbours ran from all sides and helped draw water from the well to put out the fire. Finally, the fire died down and the children clung around Saro. They knew she had been incredibly heroic. They knew that children and perhaps adults in the neighbourhood, as well as the innocent beasts owed their lives today to this courageous young girl with a fabulous presence of mind. When Saro’s mother came back home she heard the tale and simply smiled. She knew that her daughter would make her ordinary life extraordinary in the years to come.

She was right. Saro lived until the ripe old age of 89 on her own terms. Nothing could shake her faith and self-confidence. She cared not for what people thought about her and lived by her own judgement. Married to a temperamental, yet generous man, she went to start a life in the Middle East. Her husband was a jolly man who believed in living well but did not worry too much about the future of the family! She therefore knew she had to think ahead. She cultivated a little kitchen garden and reared chicken to ensure she did not spend too much on procuring food. Every week she carefully put aside a little sum of money into a box and every few months she would buy a gold coin that she knew she could sell for a profit back in India! A few days before her visit to her hometown, she would painstakingly sew in her precious gold coins into her saree skirt to escape the eagle eye of the customs official! The profit that the sale of the coins fetched would go into a piece of land. That she knew would appreciate in the years to come. She would then sell the land and invest the profits in fixed deposits in banks. She had no financial advisor, nor did she have a degree in Finance, but her Mantra was, “Live on the interest, do not touch your capital. “Several family members called her miserly because she lived thriftily but that did not deter her. Her even response was, “I don’t ask them for money, and I don’t care what they say about me”.

When the family moved back to India, she kept a small patch of land for the family and sold the rest. Her land flourished and yielded all she needed. She brought up two children, left them a small inheritance and ensured that there was enough money for her medical care put away for her last days. She left behind a small gift for every grandchild. When she crossed 65, she signed up with a group and fulfilled her desire of visiting almost every holy place in India.

She was woman who did what she had to do. Her family recalls how she was once bitten by a poisonous snake as she worked in her farm. She calmly tore off a piece of her saree, tied a tight know just above the bite, and walked briskly to the nearest Ayurvedic Hospital to get help! And she survived.

Her love for her dear ones lay hidden under her gruff exterior. She was an inspirer and a force to reckon with, but retained a quaint, childlike innocence until her last breath.

This is a story retold a thousand times, not just by family but by neighbours, friends, and relatives over generations. But this time I dedicate this story to whom it truly belongs; my grandmother; my *Ammamma.* The one who made me listen to Malayalam stories on an old radio and translated them for me when I was little. The grandmother who would open cupboards full of the most exciting treasures for a child to see and pull out clean, old bedsheets that smelt of lavender for my mattress on the floor or her room.

A tribute to the extraordinary courage, presence of mind and compassion of a young fourteen-year-old girl who looked fear in the eye and simply did what she had to do.
