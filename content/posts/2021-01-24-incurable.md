*17th of April*

10.30 am and it’s time to leave for the airport. She’s busy talking to a young couple (my brother’s friends) who had helped out at the time of Appa’s terminal illness some three months earlier. They indulge her however, in her humourless stories …and her memory lapses. There is no sign of any bags ready to be taken away with her.

My brother, Arun – who agreed to keep her (and hats off to him and his wife) – comes around and says her bag is already in the taxi in which I had come. The stories with the friends continue.

*It’s time to move!*

Where are you going? She asks me, and goes to her room to pack for herself. There are three trunks there that she rummages for clothes and finds none – because Arun has already packed them in the small bag which she is to carry with her. A week’s requirement is all that is needed. But she insists on carrying the old battery-operated shaver which her late husband hadn’t used for years. And his old comb, now almost toothless. Not to forget the little rag of a ribbon that she tied her wisp of remaining hair with. She is sprightly at the Mumbai airport. Refuses the wheelchair until she is forced into it.

We arrive at Chennai airport and after some delay at the carousel, we are out looking for a taxi to Pondicherry. On the way, we stop over at my brother-in-law’s in Tambaram. She has to use the washroom. That done, she sits down for tiffin as if it is the most natural thing to do. She tries to establish connections, between her and this brother-in-law of mine. He and his wife (in their sixties) having met her for the first time ever in their lives, marvel at this 84-year-old talking machine. I keep my plastered smile on.

We are in Pondicherry by 5.30 p.m. The house greets us with a sick feeling of something substantial lost …with the cobwebs drawn like frightful festoons across the hallway and heaps of dust like confetti boisterously strewn at a party long forgotten. Appa’s favourite chair stands forlorn in its corner.

I have booked a hotel room anyway.

*18th of April*

It is 4 a.m. and she is up, poking me. I find it irritating. Her questions. Where are we? Why did we come here? Arun has driven me out of the house, you know. Yes, he told me. His wife told me not to come back. Yes, she actually told me that I need not come back.

*Back from where?*

Huh? From … from … here! Why? What did Arun tell you? Did he tell you to take me here? What exactly did he tell you? After all that I’ve done for him, see how he throws me out. He wants his in-laws to move in with him. Yes. His wife, that @#%* has him under her thumb. D’you know? She makes me do all the house-work? Like washing the utensils and plates? Just wait and see. Really! All those who trouble me will get my curses. God will not spare them. Arun! Arun, you are responsible for the situation I am in!

*Why? Did he come here in the night?*

I don’t have any money with me. Not a penny. You understand no(?) that you need money … you should always have some money with you. And you’re making a joke out of me? Make. Make. What am I anyway?

What about our breakfast? Where’s that fellow gone? I’m dying of hunger here and he’s nowhere to be seen.

It’s 7:30 now and I manage to get something for her. Then try and catch some sleep.

Around 10 she asks for breakfast again …dying of hunger and nobody is bothered. Let it be after all, what am I? Just rubbish … to be thrown into the dustbin.

*What about the coffee and buns you had earlier?*

I’m trying to rub the sleep out of my eyes.

I had breakfast?? Never! I didn’t have anything. Anyway, let it be. I can go hungry. This is nothing new to me. When I am with you.

I am seething with suppressed rage that has been gradually boiling since at least 4 this morning. The years before that, were like the foundation on an ancestral building. There with all its strength, crawling with nether creatures, but hidden under decades of soil swept over, carelessly. I call room-service and order a repeat breakfast – in spite of her protests. And when it is brought, she says she won’t have anything unless I also eat. There are words that I have never used waiting to burst out of my mouth. The tongue, dry with suppressed rage, doesn’t move. And I thank God for little mercies.

And I go out of the room at 11, check up on the house-cleaning. Then I walk about in the blistering heat until I can’t stand it any more. I am back in the hotel room by about 1 p.m. and the stage-whisper-curses for lunch are loud and clear. I am dripping with perspiration but I call up for lunch. By the time I have a quick shower the lunch is yet to arrive. It’s a Sunday and only a handful of servers are on duty. But that’s not for her to understand.

When I used to come here with your father, I never faced all this delay. People were prompt. But now see, why should anyone bother?

In spite of the cold shower, I feel the heat rising again, and the perspiration resumes in a pathetic outflow. I feel that … perhaps … I am coming in for a stroke. And the first bad-word I have ever used against an elderly person (let alone the fact that she is my mother) jumps out, ugly as a toad. The backlash of slime leaving me guilty for a long time. I had lost my self-control. I should not have said that. She is equally shocked to hear it from me, dumbfounded and agape.

After lunch, I walk out into the sun again. People from the shops alongside look at me curiously as I wander about aimlessly in the afternoon heat, the only protection being my sun-glasses. Around 5, I visit an old friend and spend some time with him and this clears my mind somewhat, but I dread the thought of going back to the hotel room to be cooped up with her until dinner and thereafter.

I don’t have any money with me, she started soon after dinner.

*Don’t talk about money. If I give you money you will either give it to somebody and forget*

Why don’t we go to our house? Why are we staying here in this hotel? What if the

*who you gave it to or why you gave it to him, or you’ll keep it somewhere and forget*

electricity has been cut off? We can get it fixed. “Sunday”? Today is not Sunday. People

*where you have kept it. Then you will start cursing everybody for taking away your*

will come if you call them and tell them it is urgent.

*money. So, make it clear: Tell me what you need and that will be brought for you.*

Level-headed as I could be.

I shut my mind off and think of all the pleasant things that I have had in my life. I think of my wife and children back in the company quarters in Nagpur; I think of my children when they were little babies with their little heavenly smiles …and with that beautiful image I slip into a blissful sleep.

*19th of April:*

Monday. This is the day on which I have to start my work with the bank for her pension papers. That is what we had come to Pondicherry in the first place. I am pleased at the thought that I would be out of the house for most of the day. And then perhaps move out of the hotel by evening. The bank staff, not unexpectedly, make me go up and down from one person to another, to the photocopiers outside, to some authorities for the address proof, so that lunch is a hasty affair. I am exhausted by the time I come home in the evening. A quick tea and then we move to our house. The rooms have been swept and swabbed clean. It will be some time before it could be strictly called liveable, but there isn’t much of a choice about that.

Arun is going to pay very heavily for this. I’m sure he decided to throw me out of his house and then called you and asked you to take me away. What exactly did he tell you? Why don’t you tell me? I think he has done some magic on you, that’s why you are taking his side.

*He didn’t tell me anything.*

I can’t believe that! He must have given you some hint that he doesn’t want me back. Why? What have I done to him, that he should treat me like this? He has forgotten all that I have done for him. That son of his, that spoiled brat, he has grown up in my arms. His mother used to go gallivanting around town, while the baby kept crying for her. I had to look after him, washing him, feeding him, so many things you have to do for babies, you know? But he will get my curses, just see!

*20th of April:*

It is 3 a.m. and she has a new story. Arun, she says, had sent her down with me to be put her into a home for the aged there. “Who told me”? Somebody came yesterday. I can’t remember his name. How can he do this to me? You see, she says, how much I have done for him... and see what he is doing. He has thrown me out of my own house. You see? I paid for that house with my hard-earned money.

*Appa purchased it with his retirement benefits.*

And my things are there. My suitcases, trunks, Appa’s suitcase with his clothes… why don’t you take those clothes to your house? I’m sure his mother-in-law has moved in by now. She was only waiting for me to be thrown out. Arrey, do you know she has taken out so many things from the house…? My old crockery, spoons, so many other things are missing. My big wooden bed …

*All those things are still there in the house.*

You don’t get such solid teak any more, you know? How will I stay here on my own? I don’t have any money. I am just terrified at the thought of living here alone. How am I going to manage? Where they are staying, it is not our house, isn’t it? *Isn’t it?* Why don’t you answer me? What have I done to you? What happened to our house, where Appa & I were staying?

*You wrote it off to Arun, I know only that much.*

You know, I washed the dishes and utensils for them? At this age! (sobs) She wanted me to wash the clothes also. I have never done it in my father’s house, nor my husband’s house. I cannot do it. (tears). That’s why they have thrown me out of the house. You see these marks on my arm? (eyes dry) That’s acid. “How could acid fall on me”? I don’t know. But I know it is acid.

*They look like age-spots to me… scratched until the skin has come off. Acid would have eaten into your flesh.*

You think I’m lying? What did Arun tell you? To leave me here and come back? You’re not answering me, which means I’m right. He has asked you to dump me here…

That means I’m forever out, forever ….no?

Ok, then, I’ll contact our old servant, Sundar. He still stays in Bombay. I’m sure he will help me. When Appa died he did a lot. He’s a very helpful fellow…

*Yeah? I don’t seem to remember him during those last two months when we really needed a person to help. He was there at the funeral though. A guest.*

And there’s no phone from him all these days. He hasn’t asked me to come back or anything. Can you ask him if I should come back to his house or not? Please do me this favour. I’ll pay for my stay, my food. Hundred rupees per month will be enough, no?

*Who are you talking about? Sundar?*

No! Arun. Here I am dying with worry … and you’re making fun of me. And she laughed her sarcastic cackle.

The sweltering heat of the end of April is getting me on the edge. Or is it the constant bickering about Arun and everything else around her? The frequent power breakdowns only added to the misery. I go out to the sea shore, and sit down on the sand. And remember the time I had come with my brothers, long years ago, when the world was hunky-dory. I was around 10 then. How we had fought over our various finds, getting sand in our pockets, our clothes caked with wet sand. And my eyes clouded over. Over on the cloudy sea the horizon merged seamlessly with sky – with such an enviable air of permanence about it. In the mean time, we had aged and fallen apart.

The softly gathering darkness had a mellow feel as the image of my children on the same sea shore rose up before me, my son was 5 then and my daughter was 3. How lovingly they had played on the sand, laughing without a care in the world, as the tiny waves tickled their little feet – while I held them anxiously even as I enjoyed their giggles.

Will they too, someday, come here and ponder over their relationship with me?

Re-thinking my own relationship with my mother, I walked back. Almost guilty about my feelings.

You see these acid marks on my arm? (She is still talking … as I enter the house…. As I go for a shower….) No, I don’t know how I got them. Somebody must have thrown it on me when I was asleep. Did he say you take her away for some time and then bring her back? That’s my house after all. Curses be on Arun and his wife.

*You’ve left the son out?!*

I could not be cured so easily. I still had three days to go – but that’s another story.
