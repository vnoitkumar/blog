She sat by the window, gazing at the trees that swayed gently and the birds that had suddenly started chirping after COVID had silenced the urban sounds all around. The birds sang gleefully and ushered the world awake as the sun rose. She knew the birds had to be chirping, she knew that crow was cawing, and the pigeons were cooing but she could not hear them. She saw the beautiful green fairy like parrots fleeting past with exquisite grace but why did they seem silent?

Perhaps they knew there may be traps to ensnare them for the entertainment of humanity? The mynah on the windowsill was surely chirping too? The overwhelming sadness inside her seemed to have enveloped each sound around her and drowned out the noise. You yearned to hear them. But can you lose your capacity to hear if you are not heard? She wondered if the years of not being heard, when your words; those harbingers of your emotions keep coming back to you like unopened gifts slowly erodes one’s ability to hear. The gifts that she put away into the well inside her, still unopened, knowing they will remain unopened and padlocked with acceptance.

Rumi’s words flashed across her mind. “The quieter you are the more you are able to hear.” Wasn't she silent enough? Or was the turbulence in her heart so loud that it spilled over outside her like molten, smouldering lava? ***She strained to hear something, anything, but there was only silence.*** A deep, deafening silence. A silence that wrung her heart, squeezed it into a little ball and still held on, refusing to let go. Her heart felt like crumpled paper.

She walked back in time desperately looking for those milestones of happy moments. The moments that should have been etched in her mind as joyous ones. The dreams of youth broken by life’s experience. She looked at the pieces of those dreams. She was surprised to see them lying on the path to her childhood. They looked like embers, glowing resiliently though they lay helpless. As if they had little souls of hope that kept them burning. Refusing to let go of the hope of fulfilment She picked one up gently and investigated it. The embers comforted her troubled mind in a strange way but also broke her heart. She saw her greying hair in them. She walked further into the past. The pathway was green with soft fallen leaves cushioning her aching feet. She picked up a few leaves and wondered if they had broken dreams to ruminate about. They looked content as if they had a life well lived to look back on. She met herself. Thirty, struggling to keep the loose ends of her life together. She saw the tears, she saw the moments of triumph, the silent smiles. But she heard nothing. She needed to hear sorrow and joy. She sighed, stopped by the little brook and sat down looking into the flowing water. She knew there was music in flowing water. She yearned to hear it. It flowed placidly without a sound. She stopped breathing, hoping she would hear the cheerful gurgling. Silence. An all-pervasive silence.

She stood up wearily and walked further. The young woman approaching her looked familiar and she felt a rush of affection for her. She recognised herself — twenty something, full of hope and dreams. She held the young woman’s hand and looked deep into her eyes. Her vision clouded. She investigated the emotional wellspring of her own heart. She saw a huge canvas there. As beautiful, hopeful and heart-breaking as the brook that flowed soundlessly beside her. She bent forward gently and picked up the strands of emotions that grew from the roots of experiences, that life had thrown at her. She picked them up one at a time, lovingly and relived them memories. The emotions gushed out as she looked at each of them. She let them flow at first as a mighty, unstoppable river.

Hand in hand she walked further down the path now intrigued to meet the little girl that she was.

She found her, small and warm looking with large innocent eyes that shone with the unshakable verve of childhood. She bent down and into the child’s eyes. She gazed up her trustingly. She picked the little girl up and asked her, “Are you disappointed to see me?” The child shook her head. The child replied, “You did your best. I am proud of your journey and at where I am now.

She looked in wonder at the child. Together they peered into the wellspring of emotions again. The force of the gushing river ebbed, the river softened into a gentler stream, the emotions grew mellow and warm like the setting sun. She held the child’s hand and bathed in the glow She realised with a deep sense of wonder that she was at peace. She had made peace with each strand. She accepted them all with equanimity. The joy and the pain, the hope and the anguish, they were all hers. The colours of her emotions amazed her. She never knew there was such a huge spectrum of them inside her. Weren’t they woven together; those sibling emotions of joy and pain, taking turns? She looked at who she was and who she had grown into. She saw the good and the bad. She smiled at the good in her and she slowly and deliberately forgave her regrets. She looked at all those who had touched her life. She thanked the ones that had brought the moments of joy that she treasured, and she forgave the ones that had hurt her. The brook and the emotions merged. They flowed as one, peacefully and merrily.

She heard the bubbling brook faintly. She sat up and realised that she could hear again. She strained her ears and the chirping birds suddenly came alive. The crow on the opposite tree cawed. She heard the swishing of the trees. A little rabbit ran across and she heard the scurrying sound. The darkness had lifted. The clouds opened and a gentle rain soothed her. She heard the patter of the raindrops with joy. She smiled; she found her feet dancing to the rhythm of the rain. She was ready to walk forward on the leaf bed path to the future, whatever it may hold. She took the little girl back to the spot where she had met her. She hugged her and said, your dreams live in me. I live for you. I live for myself.

She cupped her hands and the rainwater gently filled in. Healing her and washing away the broken pieces of all that she had made peace with. She waved softly and let them go. She felt whole again. A melody floated into her head. Raag Miya Malhar, celebrating the rain! She enjoyed the magic of this ode to the rain and the clouds. She hummed along and a sudden happiness engulfed her. The brook turned with a soft smile. She knew with her ancient wisdom that a soul was healed. The woman dipped her hands and feet in and let the peace wash over her. The birds chirped. The trees swayed and golden sunlight poured in like liquid gold into her eyes. She looked up fearlessly and started walking back.
