I was posted at this place sometime early in my career – it was somewhere in Central India. I had landed there after having passed a few important examinations, including the ICSE, when it was under the University of Cambridge. I, therefore, had a clear idea that my English was better than most people I had met. My spellings were certainly better. Until I came here and learnt words, spellings and expressions that were a far cry from my ivory-tower training in the language of his/her majesty sitting in England. Did I say a far cry? A desperate howl would be more like it.

This guy from the welfare department came to me to tell me about some assistance that needed to be given to the wife of an employee. He had a detailed report of the investigations carried out by him in the case. The report had the date like all proper official documents, which indicated that it was prepared on the 16th of Octomber.

I told him, whatever the report may be, the spelling should be corrected to October. He looked at me quizzically. He had that look in his eye that said these people come, claiming to be highly educated, but don’t even know the basic things. I repeated that the spelling should be O-c-t-o-b-e-r.

“I am sorry, Sir. But I think my spelling is correct.” Huge embarrassed grin. Embarrassed because he could not imagine that his highly educated boss didn’t know his spellings.

“Why don’t you refer to some dictionary?”

“No need to refer to anything, Sir. Yeurybody knows that last four months of the year are September, Octomber, November, December. All ending with YUM-BEE-EEE-ARR, Sir!” I couldn’t miss the abracadabra writ large across his face. After all, the transformation of the language was nothing less than magical.

Dumbfounded, I didn’t know whether I should laugh out loud in his face or marvel at his unassailable logic!

“Um … uh … oh!”

“So, Sir. You want to change it?” Please note, he used the word “change” not “correct”.

“Uh … no … let it be,” I said. I could imagine him telling his colleagues, backslaps and all, how he taught the new boss the proper spelling of Octomber.

I was reading the report, warily, with sweaty hands, for fear of any further logical conclusions that I might have to encounter. But my man was interested in conversation.

“Sir, you were born and brought up in Bombay?”

“Yes,” I replied, almost tentatively. Not knowing what the next question would be. Like, don’t- they-teach-you-spellings-in-the-schools-there or something like that.

“I been to Bombay, Sir. Last year. Official work.” He sounded quite proud of the fact that he had gone to Bombay at official cost.

“Ok!?” Did I sound too relieved? “Was that your first visit to Bombay? How did you like …”

Before I could finish my question, he said: “Very morden place, Sir, but the peepuls there are so crowdy.”

“Crowdy?” I missed the morden altogether.

“Yes, Sir. I had to go to the Secretariat. From Churchgate Station. But it was horribal, Sir. Pushing, dashing in the platform. Then rushing in the road. No walking. Yeury peepul is running.” 

“Oh, yes. I get what you mean. There are lots of peepul, er … people …”

“Yes sir, the great city is detiorating …”

“Deteriorating. De-ter-io-rating.” I repeated the word not so much to correct him as to ensure my pronunciation wasn’t detiorating … uh... de-ter-io-rating.

“Yes sir, detiorating. You see the slums, and gabrage everywhere …”

“Garbage. Ga-rr-bage. Ok,” and before he could reiterate that there was, in fact, gabrage everywhere, I said, “let’s get back to this file …”

“Yes sir. This lady needs help because that fellow, her husband, is slightly dismantle.”

“What is that?”

He pointed his index finger towards his temple, and made a screwdriver action. “Dismantle.”

“How do you spell it? D-I-S-M-A-N-T-L-E?”

“No, Sir! D-I-S-M-E-N-T-A-L!” This time the look wasn’t quizzical at all. It was almost contemptuous.

“Oh, wow! Dismental! Yes, Dismental?” It sounded so perfect – particularly with the screwdriver motion against his temple. I sanctioned the assistance, forthwith, whatever it is that he had proposed. He had to get out before I could get mental.
