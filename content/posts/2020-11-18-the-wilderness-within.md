**W**andering, like Wordsworth, upon a lonely cloud,

**I** floated o’er the toxic fumes, emissions, and the crowd,

**L**ooking for those daffodils… that grow beside the lake,

**D**ancing in the breeze, my senses to awake.

**E**re long, I hoped, I would descry the towers of El Dorado

**R**ising from my darkness… to still my mind’s tornado.

**N**ot once did I attain the peace I sorely did pursue.

**E**ndlessly I trod my world for things that I could do

**S**omehow to get my soul at peace, clear out its wilderness, 

**S**o desperate …till I found it … in the laughter of my friends.
