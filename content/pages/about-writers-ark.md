Writerâ€™s Ark is a platform to celebrate the passion for writing. The objective is to provide a platform for budding writers to explore, learn, practice and evolve as wonderful writers. We encourage original submissions of short stories, poetry, satire, and nonfiction content. We will not accept any article that has potential to stir controversies and affect religious, political sentiments. 


Membership is by invitation only.


In our submissions, the names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the author's imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events are purely coincidental. Any specific objection from readers shall be considered if the claim is justified with proper evidence and the subject article will be removed.


Plagiarism is a crime here. 


Welcome to the Ark. The canvas is yours, writers. Go creative!
